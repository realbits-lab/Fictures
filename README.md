## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn+more+about+how+to+get+the+API+Keys+for+the+application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI+Chatbot&demo-description=An+Open-Source+AI+Chatbot+Template+Built+With+Next.js+and+the+AI+SDK+by+Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22grok%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22xai%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22upstash-kv%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22upstash%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%7D%5D)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

### Authentication Testing Setup

This project uses Playwright for testing with Google OAuth authentication. Follow these steps to set up authenticated testing:

**Step 1: Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env.test` file with your Google test credentials:
```bash
GOOGLE_TEST_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com  
GOOGLE_TEST_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Step 2: Create Authentication State**
Generate the `user.json` file containing Google OAuth cookies:
```bash
# Interactive setup - opens browser and automates Google login
npx playwright test --project=manual-setup --headed
```

This command will:
- Open a browser window showing the authentication process
- Navigate to your login page  
- Automatically fill email from `.env.test`
- Handle Google OAuth popup/redirect
- Auto-fill email and password in Google's sign-in form
- Complete authentication and save cookies to `playwright/.auth/user.json`

**Step 3: Run Authenticated Tests**
```bash
# Run tests using saved authentication state
npx playwright test --project=authenticated --headed

# Test specific authenticated features  
npx playwright test tests/auth/storage-state-demo.test.ts --project=authenticated --headed

# Run all test projects
npx playwright test
```

### Test Projects

- **`manual-setup`**: Creates `user.json` with Google OAuth authentication  
- **`authenticated`**: Tests that use saved authentication from `user.json`
- **`e2e`**: End-to-end application tests
- **`routes`**: Route-specific functionality tests

### Test Commands
```bash  
# Basic test commands
pnpm test                           # Run all tests
npx playwright test --headed        # Run with browser visible
npx playwright test --debug         # Debug mode with inspector
npx playwright test --ui            # Interactive UI mode

# Authentication-specific commands  
npx playwright test --project=manual-setup --headed    # Create user.json
npx playwright test --project=authenticated --headed   # Use user.json
```

The authentication system bypasses Google's "browser not secure" detection using specialized Chrome configurations and automated form filling.
