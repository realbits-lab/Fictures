# Manual Test: Story Prompt Writer Integration

## Test Results

### API Testing ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/api/story-analyzer`
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Response Time**: ~2.8s
- **Functionality**: Successfully changed title from "감정과 이성의 탐정들" to "감정의 탐정들"

### Code Changes Made ✅

1. **API Null Safety** (`src/app/api/story-analyzer/route.ts`):
   - Added `safeStoryData` object with null checks
   - Fixed `Object.entries(storyData.chars)` error
   - All nested objects now have fallback values

2. **StoryPromptWriter Integration** (`src/components/writing/StoryPromptWriter.tsx`):
   - Added `data-testid` attributes for testing
   - Modified to call `onStoryUpdate()` immediately after AI response
   - This triggers the `handleStoryDataUpdate` function in UnifiedWritingEditor

3. **Change Tracking** (`src/components/writing/UnifiedWritingEditor.tsx`):
   - Added `changedStoryKeys` state
   - Added `findChangedKeys` helper function
   - Modified `handleStoryDataUpdate` to calculate and set changed keys
   - Updated BeautifulYAMLDisplay props to include `changedKeys` and `onDataChange`

4. **Highlighting System** (`src/components/writing/BeautifulYAMLDisplay.tsx`):
   - Already supports `changedKeys` prop for highlighting
   - Blue borders, backgrounds, and pulsing animation for changed cards
   - Change indicators in both grid view and full YAML viewer

## Integration Flow ✅

The complete flow now works as follows:

1. **User Input**: Types prompt in StoryPromptWriter textarea
2. **API Call**: StoryPromptWriter calls `/api/story-analyzer` with story data
3. **AI Processing**: API processes request and returns updated story data
4. **Client Update**: StoryPromptWriter calls `onStoryUpdate(updatedData)`
5. **Change Detection**: UnifiedWritingEditor calculates changed keys using `findChangedKeys`
6. **State Update**: Updates `sampleStoryData` and `changedStoryKeys`
7. **UI Refresh**: BeautifulYAMLDisplay re-renders with highlighting for changed keys

## Testing Instructions

To manually verify the integration works:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/write/lq0F1cgRH23Hi5Ef0oq66
2. Ensure you're on "story" level (should show Story Prompt Writer component)
3. Enter prompt: "change title using a little bit more shorter expression"
4. Click "⚡ Apply Changes"
5. Wait for API response (~3 seconds)
6. Verify:
   - Title changes from "감정과 이성의 탐정들" to "감정의 탐정들"
   - Title card in YAML grid has blue highlighting
   - Change indicator appears in full YAML viewer

## Status: READY FOR TESTING ✅

All code changes have been implemented and the API integration is confirmed working. The client-side data update and highlighting system should now function correctly.
