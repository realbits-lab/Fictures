## Best Practices

### Part Development

1. **Story Context Awareness**: Always consider part's role within complete story structure
2. **Framework-Driven Planning**: Use Part Planning Framework elements as development checklist
3. **Character-Centric Development**: Ensure character arcs drive part narrative progression
4. **Thematic Integration**: Weave themes naturally throughout part content

### AI Collaboration

1. **Context-Rich Prompting**: Provide comprehensive story and part context for AI generation
2. **Framework Alignment**: Ensure AI-generated content addresses all Part Planning Framework elements
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use AI as collaborative partner for content enhancement and quality improvement
4. **Consistency Maintenance**: Regularly validate AI-generated content against established story elements

### Quality Management

1. **Framework Compliance**: Verify all Part Planning Framework elements are thoroughly addressed
2. **Story Integration Validation**: Ensure part connects seamlessly with previous and following parts
3. **Character Development Tracking**: Monitor character arc progression throughout part development
4. **Thematic Consistency**: Maintain thematic coherence while allowing for part-specific focus
