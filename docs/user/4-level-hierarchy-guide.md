## The Four Levels

**Examples:**

Sections within a story that group related chapters together.

**Examples:**
- Story: "The Fellowship of the Ring"
  - Part 1: "The Ring Sets Out"

### 📝 **Chapter** (Level 4)
Individual chapters within each part.

**Examples:**
- Part: "The Ring Sets Out"
  - Chapter 1: "A Long-Expected Party"
  - Chapter 2: "The Shadow of the Past"

### 🎬 **Scene** (Level 5)
Individual scenes within each chapter for detailed organization.

**Examples:**
