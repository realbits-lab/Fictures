# Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS) for Serialized Fiction

## Section 1: Introduction and Systems-Oriented Framework

This document provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework for planning, generating, validating, and evaluating serialized fiction. It transforms storytelling from unstructured creative processes into a systematic approach using the "Story as Data" paradigm, enabling procedural generation and AI-assisted narrative creation.

The framework is built on the **Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS)**, a four-level data architecture that encapsulates story structure from the highest conceptual level down to individual scenes. This structured representation serves as the foundation for automated validation, AI-powered visualization, and systematic evaluation of narrative quality.

---

## Section 2: Story Specification (Level 1: Overall Narrative)

### 2.1 Definition and Purpose

The **Story** level represents the complete narrative at its most abstract level. It contains the core conceptual DNA of the work, serving as the foundational input for the entire generation process. The story object encapsulates the essential elements: a unique identifier, title, genre array, premise statement, dramatic question, thematic message, and references to all characters, settings, and parts that comprise the narrative.

### 2.2 Key Functions in Planning

- **Premise Development**: Craft a single, succinct sentence (under 20 words) that encapsulates the entire novel, tying together the big-picture conflict with personal stakes
- **Dramatic Question Formation**: Define the central yes-or-no question that drives the narrative and must be answered in the climax
- **Theme Articulation**: Establish a concise statement of the story's central message to guide narrative coherence
- **Genre Classification**: Specify primary and secondary genres as an array to inform stylistic choices in text and image generation
- **Character Registry**: Maintain an array of character_ids linking to all major and minor characters
- **Setting Catalog**: Track an array of setting_ids for all key locations in the story world
- **Part Structure**: Define the array of part_ids representing major structural divisions (typically three acts)
- **Unique Identification**: Generate a story_id (UUID) for database management and tracking

### 2.3 Story Organization and Part Structure

The story structure is defined through the 'parts' array containing part_ids that reference major narrative divisions. Each part maps to a structural role within the Three-Act Structure.

**Standard Three-Act Implementation (as per JSON example):**

- **part_001**: Maps to "Act 1: Setup" - Introduces characters, establishes the ordinary world, presents the inciting incident
- **part_002**: Maps to "Act 2: Confrontation" - Develops rising action, presents obstacles, builds to climax
- **part_003**: Maps to "Act 3: Resolution" - Resolves conflicts, completes character arcs, provides closure

**Key Structural Elements:**

- Each part contains an ordered array of chapter_ids
- Parts maintain their own summary paragraphs describing major movements
- Key beats are tracked for narrative validation (e.g., "Inciting Incident" in Act 1)
- The structural_role field ensures adherence to proven dramatic frameworks

**Data Relationships:**

- Story object references parts through part_ids array
- Parts reference chapters through chapter_ids array
- Chapters reference scenes through scene_ids array
- This hierarchical structure enables both top-down planning and bottom-up validation

## Section 5: Scene Specification (Level 4: Individual Scenes)

### 5.1 The Foundational Principle: A Scene is a Unit of Change

The single most critical principle of scene construction is that a **scene must create meaningful change**. Each scene contains a unique scene_id, sequential number, chapter reference, array of character_ids, setting_id link, POV character identifier, narrative voice specification, one-sentence summary, entry hook, clear goal statement, defined conflict, outcome enum, and emotional shift tracking. A scene advances the story through tangible change in a character's situation, either externally or internally.

### 5.2 The Core Architecture: Scene-Sequel Model

Scenes follow the **Scene-Sequel** model, creating an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. This architecture directly maps to the JSON structure's goal, conflict, and outcome fields:

#### 5.2.1 The Scene (Action Unit)

1. **Goal**: POV character enters with specific, immediate objective (maps to 'goal' field)
2. **Conflict**: The obstacle preventing easy achievement (maps to 'conflict' field)
3. **Outcome**: Result tracked as enum values:
   - 'failure': Complete failure to achieve goal
   - 'success': Goal achieved as intended
   - 'success_with_cost': Goal achieved but with negative consequences
   - 'failure_with_discovery': Failed but learned something important

#### 5.2.2 The Sequel (Reaction Unit)

1. **Emotional Shift**: Tracked through the 'emotional_shift' object with 'from' and 'to' states
2. **Processing**: Character internalizes the outcome (reflected in narrative voice)
3. **New Direction**: Decision becomes the goal for the next scene (continuity through scene_ids array)

### 5.3 Line-Level Execution: Scene Components

Scenes are constructed with specific data elements for consistency:

- **Entry Hook**: Opening line or action for immediate reader engagement
- **POV Management**: Tracked through 'pov_character_id' field
- **Narrative Voice**: Specified as enum ('third_person_limited', 'first_person', etc.)
- **Character Presence**: All participants tracked in 'character_ids' array
- **Setting Context**: Location linked through 'setting_id'
- **Summary**: One-sentence description of core action or purpose
- **Emotional Arc**: Tracked from beginning to end state for character development

### 5.4 JSON Data Structure for Scene Object

#### Field Descriptions

**scene_id**: A unique identifier for the scene.

**scene_number**: The sequential number of the scene within the chapter.

**chapter_ref**: Reference to the chapter this scene belongs to.

**character_ids**: An array of character IDs for all characters present or referenced in the scene.

**setting_id**: A link to the specific Setting object where the scene takes place.

**pov_character_id**: The identifier of the character from whose point of view the scene is told.

**narrative_voice**: The narrative perspective (e.g., "third_person_limited", "first_person").

**summary**: A one-sentence description of the scene's core action or purpose.

**entry_hook**: The opening line or action designed to immediately engage the reader.

**goal**: A clear statement of what the point-of-view character wants to achieve in the scene.

**conflict**: The obstacle, internal or external, that prevents the character from easily achieving their goal.

**outcome**: The result of the conflict, typically an enum ('success', 'failure', 'success_with_cost', 'failure_with_discovery'). This outcome drives the plot forward into the next scene.

**emotional_shift**: A description of the change in the POV character's emotional state from the beginning to the end of the scene (e.g., from "hopeful" to "terrified"). This is crucial for tracking character arcs.

#### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "scene": {
    "scene_id": "scene_001",
    "scene_number": 1,
    "chapter_ref": "chap_001",
    "character_ids": ["char_maya_001", "char_elena_002"],
    "setting_id": "setting_elena_apt_001",
    "pov_character_id": "char_maya_001",
    "narrative_voice": "third_person_limited",
    "summary": "Maya arrives for coffee date, finds Elena's door unlocked and apartment empty with signs of struggle",
    "entry_hook": "The door to Elena's apartment stood ajar, a sliver of darkness where warmth should be.",

## Section 8: Procedural Methodology for Narrative Generation

### 8.1 The Iterative Refinement Paradigm

Iterative refinement breaks novel creation into manageable sequential steps following the Snowflake Method: starting with a single sentence and progressively expanding with greater detail at each stage. This approach avoids cognitive overload by building the story layer by layer—from one-sentence premise to paragraph summary, then character profiles and detailed synopsis.

**AI Augmentation Benefits:**

- LLMs serve as brainstorming assistants, not autonomous authors
- Generate multiple options at each narrative layer
- Human creators curate and guide AI output
- Combines AI's rapid generation with human creative selection

### 8.2 The AI-Augmented Snowflake Algorithm

Maps Snowflake Method stages to HNS population with LLM assistance:

#### 8.2.1 Step 1: Core Concept Generation (Story Object)

- **Action**: Create one-sentence summary
- **Target**: Story object fields
- **AI Process**: Generate multiple premise variations under 20 words
- **Human Task**: Select best premise, define dramatic_question and theme
- **Output**: Populate premise, dramatic_question, theme, genre fields

**Example Prompt**: "Given the story idea 'a wizard who has lost his magic,' generate 5 one-sentence premises under 20 words with protagonist, conflict, and personal stakes."

#### 8.2.2 Step 2: Act-Level Structuring (Part Objects)

- **Action**: Expand premise to five-sentence paragraph
- **Target**: Part objects (three acts)
- **AI Process**: Structure as "three disasters plus ending"
- **Human Task**: Review, refine, segment into three acts
- **Output**: Create Part objects with structural_role, summary, key_beats

**Example Prompt**: "Expand premise into 5 sentences: 1) Setup/ordinary world, 2-4) Three escalating disasters, 5) Resolution."

#### 8.2.3 Step 3: Character Conception (Character Objects)

- **Action**: Create character profiles from story summary
- **Target**: Character objects
- **AI Process**: Identify protagonist, antagonist, key allies with storylines
- **Human Task**: Add psychological depth and nuance
- **Output**: Populate character profiles with goals, conflicts, epiphanies

**Profile Elements**: 1) One-sentence storyline, 2) Primary goal, 3) Main conflict, 4) Character epiphany

#### 8.2.4 Step 4: Chapter-Level Expansion (Chapter Objects)

- **Action**: Expand each act sentence to full paragraph
- **Target**: Chapter objects
- **AI Process**: Generate 150-word paragraphs ending with complications
- **Human Task**: Ensure cohesive, escalating plot progression
- **Output**: Populate Chapter.summary fields

#### 8.2.5 Step 5: Scene Breakdown (Scene Objects)

- **Action**: Break chapters into 3-5 discrete scenes
- **Target**: Scene objects
- **AI Process**: Generate scene descriptions with action, setting, characters
- **Human Task**: Adjust flow and populate scene attributes
- **Output**: Complete scene-by-scene outline with all fields populated

### 8.3 Implementation Summary

This five-step process transforms initial concepts into detailed, machine-readable narrative blueprints ready for validation and prose generation. Each step builds on previous layers, ensuring structural coherence while maintaining creative flexibility through human curation.

## Section 9: Validation and Coherence Auditing

### 9.1 The Challenge of Narrative Coherence

A compelling narrative requires absolute coherence—events must follow logical cause-and-effect chains, characters must act consistently with their established personalities, and story world rules must be respected. The risk of incoherence is magnified in procedural or AI-assisted generation.

### 9.2 Dual-System Validation Framework

#### System 1: Narrative State Tracker (Symbolic Validation)

Tracks objective state of story entities using a key-value store:

**Tracked States:**

- Character States: `character_A.status = 'alive'`, `character_B.location = 'castle'`
- Object States: `magic_sword.owner = 'character_A'`, `magic_sword.status = 'intact'`
- Knowledge States: `character_C.knows('secret') = true`
- Relationship States: `relationship(A, B).status = 'allies'`

**Implementation:**

```yaml
validation_checks:
  pre_conditions:
    - ASSERT(character_A.status == 'alive')
    - ASSERT(character_A.location == scene.location)
    - ASSERT(object.owner == character_A)

  post_conditions:
    - UPDATE(object.owner = character_B)
    - UPDATE(character_A.knows('betrayal') = true)
```

#### System 2: LLM Logic & Emotion Auditor (Semantic Validation)

Uses AI to evaluate nuanced narrative coherence:

**Causality Check:**

- Evaluates logical progression between scenes
- Identifies missing steps or logical gaps
- Suggests bridging scenes when needed

**Character Consistency Check:**

- Compares character actions against established profile
- Flags out-of-character behavior
- Evaluates psychological plausibility

**Emotional Arc Check:**

- Tracks emotional progression across scenes
- Identifies unearned emotional shifts
- Ensures organic character development
