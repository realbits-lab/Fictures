# Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS) for Serialized Fiction

## Section 1: Introduction and Systems-Oriented Framework

This document provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework for planning, generating, validating, and evaluating serialized fiction. It transforms storytelling from unstructured creative processes into a systematic approach using the "Story as Data" paradigm, enabling procedural generation and AI-assisted narrative creation.

The framework is built on the **Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS)**, a four-level data architecture that encapsulates story structure from the highest conceptual level down to individual scenes. This structured representation serves as the foundation for automated validation, AI-powered visualization, and systematic evaluation of narrative quality.

---

## Section 2: Story Specification (Level 1: Overall Narrative)

### 2.1 Definition and Purpose

The **Story** level represents the complete narrative at its most abstract level. It contains the core conceptual DNA of the work, serving as the foundational input for the entire generation process. The story object encapsulates the essential elements: a unique identifier, title, genre array, premise statement, dramatic question, thematic message, and references to all characters, settings, and parts that comprise the narrative.

### 2.2 Key Functions in Planning

- **Premise Development**: Craft a single, succinct sentence (under 20 words) that encapsulates the entire novel, tying together the big-picture conflict with personal stakes
- **Dramatic Question Formation**: Define the central yes-or-no question that drives the narrative and must be answered in the climax
- **Theme Articulation**: Establish a concise statement of the story's central message to guide narrative coherence
- **Genre Classification**: Specify primary and secondary genres as an array to inform stylistic choices in text and image generation
- **Character Registry**: Maintain an array of character_ids linking to all major and minor characters
- **Setting Catalog**: Track an array of setting_ids for all key locations in the story world
- **Part Structure**: Define the array of part_ids representing major structural divisions (typically three acts)
- **Unique Identification**: Generate a story_id (UUID) for database management and tracking

### 2.3 Story Organization and Part Structure

The story structure is defined through the 'parts' array containing part_ids that reference major narrative divisions. Each part maps to a structural role within the Three-Act Structure.

**Standard Three-Act Implementation (as per JSON example):**

- **part_001**: Maps to "Act 1: Setup" - Introduces characters, establishes the ordinary world, presents the inciting incident
- **part_002**: Maps to "Act 2: Confrontation" - Develops rising action, presents obstacles, builds to climax
- **part_003**: Maps to "Act 3: Resolution" - Resolves conflicts, completes character arcs, provides closure

**Key Structural Elements:**

- Each part contains an ordered array of chapter_ids
- Parts maintain their own summary paragraphs describing major movements
- Key beats are tracked for narrative validation (e.g., "Inciting Incident" in Act 1)
- The structural_role field ensures adherence to proven dramatic frameworks

**Data Relationships:**

- Story object references parts through part_ids array
- Parts reference chapters through chapter_ids array
- Chapters reference scenes through scene_ids array
- This hierarchical structure enables both top-down planning and bottom-up validation

## Section 4: Chapter Specification (Level 3: Reading Units)

### 4.1 Definition and Purpose

The **Chapter** is the primary unit of reader consumption, especially critical in web novel format. Each chapter contains a unique chapter_id, sequential number, title, reference to its parent part, detailed summary paragraph, pacing goal enum, action-to-dialogue ratio, structured chapter hook object, and ordered array of scene_ids. Chapters must balance being self-contained reading experiences while advancing the larger narrative through carefully designed hooks and pacing.

### 4.2 Key Functions in Planning

- **Summary Creation**: Develop detailed one-paragraph summaries corresponding to expanded Snowflake Method paragraphs
- **Pacing Goal Setting**: Assign tempo enums ('fast', 'medium', 'slow', 'reflective') to guide prose generation
- **Action-Dialogue Balance**: Define percentage ratios (e.g., "40:60") for narrative composition

## Section 5: Scene Specification (Level 4: Individual Scenes)

### 5.1 The Foundational Principle: A Scene is a Unit of Change

The single most critical principle of scene construction is that a **scene must create meaningful change**. Each scene contains a unique scene_id, sequential number, chapter reference, array of character_ids, setting_id link, POV character identifier, narrative voice specification, one-sentence summary, entry hook, clear goal statement, defined conflict, outcome enum, and emotional shift tracking. A scene advances the story through tangible change in a character's situation, either externally or internally.

### 5.2 The Core Architecture: Scene-Sequel Model

Scenes follow the **Scene-Sequel** model, creating an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. This architecture directly maps to the JSON structure's goal, conflict, and outcome fields:

#### 5.2.1 The Scene (Action Unit)

1. **Goal**: POV character enters with specific, immediate objective (maps to 'goal' field)
2. **Conflict**: The obstacle preventing easy achievement (maps to 'conflict' field)
3. **Outcome**: Result tracked as enum values:
   - 'failure': Complete failure to achieve goal
   - 'success': Goal achieved as intended
   - 'success_with_cost': Goal achieved but with negative consequences
   - 'failure_with_discovery': Failed but learned something important

#### 5.2.2 The Sequel (Reaction Unit)

1. **Emotional Shift**: Tracked through the 'emotional_shift' object with 'from' and 'to' states
2. **Processing**: Character internalizes the outcome (reflected in narrative voice)
3. **New Direction**: Decision becomes the goal for the next scene (continuity through scene_ids array)

### 5.3 Line-Level Execution: Scene Components

Scenes are constructed with specific data elements for consistency:

- **Entry Hook**: Opening line or action for immediate reader engagement
- **POV Management**: Tracked through 'pov_character_id' field
- **Narrative Voice**: Specified as enum ('third_person_limited', 'first_person', etc.)
- **Character Presence**: All participants tracked in 'character_ids' array
- **Setting Context**: Location linked through 'setting_id'
- **Summary**: One-sentence description of core action or purpose
- **Emotional Arc**: Tracked from beginning to end state for character development

### 5.4 JSON Data Structure for Scene Object

#### Field Descriptions

**scene_id**: A unique identifier for the scene.

**scene_number**: The sequential number of the scene within the chapter.

**chapter_ref**: Reference to the chapter this scene belongs to.

**character_ids**: An array of character IDs for all characters present or referenced in the scene.

**setting_id**: A link to the specific Setting object where the scene takes place.

**pov_character_id**: The identifier of the character from whose point of view the scene is told.

**narrative_voice**: The narrative perspective (e.g., "third_person_limited", "first_person").

**summary**: A one-sentence description of the scene's core action or purpose.

**entry_hook**: The opening line or action designed to immediately engage the reader.

**goal**: A clear statement of what the point-of-view character wants to achieve in the scene.

**conflict**: The obstacle, internal or external, that prevents the character from easily achieving their goal.

**outcome**: The result of the conflict, typically an enum ('success', 'failure', 'success_with_cost', 'failure_with_discovery'). This outcome drives the plot forward into the next scene.

**emotional_shift**: A description of the change in the POV character's emotional state from the beginning to the end of the scene (e.g., from "hopeful" to "terrified"). This is crucial for tracking character arcs.

#### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "scene": {
    "scene_id": "scene_001",
    "scene_number": 1,
    "chapter_ref": "chap_001",
    "character_ids": ["char_maya_001", "char_elena_002"],
    "setting_id": "setting_elena_apt_001",
    "pov_character_id": "char_maya_001",
    "narrative_voice": "third_person_limited",
    "summary": "Maya arrives for coffee date, finds Elena's door unlocked and apartment empty with signs of struggle",
    "entry_hook": "The door to Elena's apartment stood ajar, a sliver of darkness where warmth should be.",
    "goal": "Have normal coffee date with Elena",

## Section 8: A Procedural Methodology for Narrative Generation

### 8.1 The Iterative Refinement Paradigm

The process of creating a complex narrative from a simple idea can be a daunting task, often leading to writer's block or significant structural issues that require extensive rewrites. The core principle to overcome this is iterative refinement, a paradigm that breaks down the monumental task of writing a novel into a series of smaller, manageable, and logically sequential steps. This approach, exemplified by the Snowflake Method, involves starting with the most basic element of the story—a single sentence—and progressively expanding it with greater detail at each stage.

This methodology works because it mirrors the way the human brain naturally processes and develops complex ideas. It avoids the cognitive overload of trying to manage characters, plot, setting, and theme simultaneously from the outset. Instead, it ensures the foundational structure is sound before investing time in detailed execution. By building the story layer by layer, from a one-sentence summary to a paragraph, then to character profiles and a multi-page synopsis, the writer ensures that all elements are interconnected and serve the core premise. This structured progression provides a clear sense of direction and control, significantly reducing the likelihood of major plot holes or inconsistent character arcs later in the process.

In a modern content pipeline, this paradigm can be powerfully augmented with generative AI. The iterative nature of the Snowflake Method aligns perfectly with the conversational, request-and-refine workflow of interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). The AI does not serve as an autonomous author but as a "design partner" or a tireless brainstorming assistant. At each step, the AI can generate multiple options based on the previously established layer, allowing the human creator to act as a curator and guide. This human-in-the-loop model leverages the AI's strength in rapid, structured content generation while reserving the uniquely human skills of creative selection, taste, and the infusion of emotional depth. The result is a highly efficient, structured, and collaborative process that transforms a blank page into a fully plotted narrative.

### 8.2 The AI-Augmented Snowflake Algorithm

The following algorithm formalizes the iterative refinement paradigm into a concrete, step-by-step workflow. It directly maps the stages of the Snowflake Method to the population of the Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS), integrating specific LLM prompts at each phase to assist the human creator.

**Step 1: Core Concept Generation (Populating the Story Object)**

Action: Write a one-sentence summary of the novel.

Target HNS Object: Story.

AI-Assisted Process: The creator begins with a nascent idea. An LLM is used to brainstorm and refine this idea into a compelling, concise premise. The AI can generate multiple variations, helping to crystallize the core conflict and stakes.

Example LLM Prompt: Act as an expert novel outliner. Given the rough story idea "a wizard who has lost his magic," generate 5 potential one-sentence premises. Each premise must be under 20 words, introduce a clear protagonist, a core conflict, and hint at the personal stakes involved.

Human Curation Task: The creator selects the most compelling premise from the AI-generated options. They then manually define the dramatic_question and theme that best align with the chosen premise.

Output: The Story.premise, Story.dramatic_question, Story.theme, and Story.genre fields are populated.

**Step 2: Act-Level Structuring (Populating Part Objects)**

Action: Expand the one-sentence summary into a one-paragraph summary.

Target HNS Object: Part.

AI-Assisted Process: The chosen premise is fed back to the LLM, which is instructed to expand it into a paragraph that follows the classic three-act structure. This ensures the narrative has a solid beginning, middle, and end from the very beginning. The structure is typically "three disasters plus an ending".

Example LLM Prompt: Based on the premise: "", write a five-sentence summary paragraph for the novel. The first sentence should establish the setup and the protagonist's ordinary world. The next three sentences should each describe a major disaster or turning point that escalates the conflict. The final sentence should describe the story's resolution or ending.

Human Curation Task: The creator reviews the AI-generated paragraph for logical flow and dramatic potential. They refine the wording and then segment the paragraph into three distinct parts, corresponding to Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3.

Output: Three Part objects are created. The Part.structural_role is set to "Act 1," "Act 2," and "Act 3," and the corresponding sentences from the summary paragraph populate each Part.summary. Key beats like "Inciting Incident" and "Climax" are identified and added to Part.key_beats.

**Step 3: Character Conception (Creating Character Objects)**

Action: Create summary sheets for all major characters.

Target HNS Object: Character.

AI-Assisted Process: The LLM analyzes the one-paragraph story summary to identify the primary characters (protagonist, antagonist, key allies). For each identified character, it generates a foundational profile based on the structure recommended by the Snowflake Method.

Example LLM Prompt: Analyze the following story summary: "". Identify the protagonist, the primary antagonist, and one key supporting character. For each character, generate a profile containing: 1. A one-sentence summary of their storyline. 2. Their primary goal in the story. 3. Their main conflict (what prevents them from reaching their goal). 4. Their epiphany (what they will learn or how they will change).

Human Curation Task: The creator reviews and refines these initial character sketches, adding nuance, depth, and ensuring the goals and conflicts are compelling. This is a critical step for infusing the story with human-level psychological complexity.

Output: Initial Character objects are created and populated with their core narrative functions.

**Step 4: Chapter-Level Expansion (Populating Chapter Objects)**

Action: Expand each sentence of the summary paragraph into a full paragraph.

Target HNS Object: Chapter.

AI-Assisted Process: This step systematically builds out the plot. Each sentence from the five-sentence summary (generated in Step 2) is treated as the topic sentence for a full paragraph. The LLM expands each of these sentences into a more detailed paragraph that describes the events of a single chapter or a small group of chapters. A key instruction is to end each paragraph with a complication or "disaster" to maintain forward momentum.

Example LLM Prompt: Take the following sentence, which represents a major story beat: "". Expand this sentence into a full paragraph of approximately 150 words, detailing the key events that occur. The paragraph should end with a significant setback, complication, or disaster for the protagonist.

Human Curation Task: The creator reviews the five expanded paragraphs, ensuring they form a cohesive and escalating plot. They then assign these paragraphs as the summary for the initial Chapter objects in the HNS.

Output: The Chapter.summary field is populated for the key structural chapters of the story.

**Step 5: Scene Breakdown (Populating Scene Objects)**

Action: Make a list of scenes.

Target HNS Object: Scene.

AI-Assisted Process: The creator now takes each chapter summary paragraph and uses the LLM to break it down into a sequence of discrete scenes. This step translates the narrative from a summary into a list of actionable events.

Example LLM Prompt: Given the following chapter summary: "[Chapter.summary]". Break this down into a list of 3 to 5 distinct scenes required to tell this part of the story. For each scene, provide a one-sentence description of the key action, the setting, and the characters involved.

Human Curation Task: The creator reviews the scene list, adjusting the flow, order, and content to ensure a logical and engaging progression within the chapter. They then populate the core attributes of each Scene object (summary, setting_id, etc.).

Output: Scene objects are created within each chapter, and their summary fields are populated, creating a complete, scene-by-scene outline of the entire novel.

This structured, AI-augmented process provides a clear and repeatable path from a high-level concept to a detailed, machine-readable narrative blueprint, ready for validation and prose generation.

## Section 9: Validation and Coherence Auditing

### 9.1 The Challenge of Narrative Coherence

A compelling narrative requires absolute coherence—events must follow logical cause-and-effect chains, characters must act consistently with their established personalities, and story world rules must be respected. The risk of incoherence is magnified in procedural or AI-assisted generation.

### 9.2 Dual-System Validation Framework

#### System 1: Narrative State Tracker (Symbolic Validation)

Tracks objective state of story entities using a key-value store:

**Tracked States:**

- Character States: `character_A.status = 'alive'`, `character_B.location = 'castle'`
- Object States: `magic_sword.owner = 'character_A'`, `magic_sword.status = 'intact'`
- Knowledge States: `character_C.knows('secret') = true`
- Relationship States: `relationship(A, B).status = 'allies'`

**Implementation:**

```yaml
validation_checks:
  pre_conditions:
    - ASSERT(character_A.status == 'alive')
    - ASSERT(character_A.location == scene.location)
    - ASSERT(object.owner == character_A)

  post_conditions:
    - UPDATE(object.owner = character_B)
    - UPDATE(character_A.knows('betrayal') = true)
```

#### System 2: LLM Logic & Emotion Auditor (Semantic Validation)

Uses AI to evaluate nuanced narrative coherence:

**Causality Check:**

- Evaluates logical progression between scenes
- Identifies missing steps or logical gaps
- Suggests bridging scenes when needed

**Character Consistency Check:**

- Compares character actions against established profile
- Flags out-of-character behavior
- Evaluates psychological plausibility

**Emotional Arc Check:**

- Tracks emotional progression across scenes
- Identifies unearned emotional shifts
- Ensures organic character development
