# Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS) for Serialized Fiction

## Section 1: Introduction and Systems-Oriented Framework

This document provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework for planning, generating, validating, and evaluating serialized fiction. It transforms storytelling from unstructured creative processes into a systematic approach using the "Story as Data" paradigm, enabling procedural generation and AI-assisted narrative creation.

The framework is built on the **Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS)**, a four-level data architecture that encapsulates story structure from the highest conceptual level down to individual scenes. This structured representation serves as the foundation for automated validation, AI-powered visualization, and systematic evaluation of narrative quality.

---

## Section 2: Story Specification (Level 1: Overall Narrative)

### 2.1 Definition and Purpose

The **Story** level represents the complete narrative at its most abstract level. It contains the core conceptual DNA of the work, serving as the foundational input for the entire generation process. The story object encapsulates the essential elements: a unique identifier, title, genre array, premise statement, dramatic question, thematic message, and references to all characters, settings, and parts that comprise the narrative.

### 2.2 Key Functions in Planning

- **Premise Development**: Craft a single, succinct sentence (under 20 words) that encapsulates the entire novel, tying together the big-picture conflict with personal stakes
- **Dramatic Question Formation**: Define the central yes-or-no question that drives the narrative and must be answered in the climax
- **Theme Articulation**: Establish a concise statement of the story's central message to guide narrative coherence
- **Genre Classification**: Specify primary and secondary genres as an array to inform stylistic choices in text and image generation
- **Character Registry**: Maintain an array of character_ids linking to all major and minor characters
- **Setting Catalog**: Track an array of setting_ids for all key locations in the story world
- **Part Structure**: Define the array of part_ids representing major structural divisions (typically three acts)
- **Unique Identification**: Generate a story_id (UUID) for database management and tracking

### 2.3 Story Organization and Part Structure

The story structure is defined through the 'parts' array containing part_ids that reference major narrative divisions. Each part maps to a structural role within the Three-Act Structure.

**Standard Three-Act Implementation (as per JSON example):**

- **part_001**: Maps to "Act 1: Setup" - Introduces characters, establishes the ordinary world, presents the inciting incident
- **part_002**: Maps to "Act 2: Confrontation" - Develops rising action, presents obstacles, builds to climax
- **part_003**: Maps to "Act 3: Resolution" - Resolves conflicts, completes character arcs, provides closure

**Key Structural Elements:**

- Each part contains an ordered array of chapter_ids
- Parts maintain their own summary paragraphs describing major movements
- Key beats are tracked for narrative validation (e.g., "Inciting Incident" in Act 1)
- The structural_role field ensures adherence to proven dramatic frameworks

**Data Relationships:**

- Story object references parts through part_ids array
- Parts reference chapters through chapter_ids array
- Chapters reference scenes through scene_ids array
- This hierarchical structure enables both top-down planning and bottom-up validation

## Section 5: Scene Specification (Level 4: Individual Scenes)

### 5.1 The Foundational Principle: A Scene is a Unit of Change

The single most critical principle of scene construction is that a **scene must create meaningful change**. Each scene contains a unique scene_id, sequential number, chapter reference, array of character_ids, setting_id link, POV character identifier, narrative voice specification, one-sentence summary, entry hook, clear goal statement, defined conflict, outcome enum, and emotional shift tracking. A scene advances the story through tangible change in a character's situation, either externally or internally.

### 5.2 The Core Architecture: Scene-Sequel Model

Scenes follow the **Scene-Sequel** model, creating an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. This architecture directly maps to the JSON structure's goal, conflict, and outcome fields:

#### 5.2.1 The Scene (Action Unit)

1. **Goal**: POV character enters with specific, immediate objective (maps to 'goal' field)
2. **Conflict**: The obstacle preventing easy achievement (maps to 'conflict' field)
3. **Outcome**: Result tracked as enum values:
   - 'failure': Complete failure to achieve goal
   - 'success': Goal achieved as intended
   - 'success_with_cost': Goal achieved but with negative consequences
   - 'failure_with_discovery': Failed but learned something important

#### 5.2.2 The Sequel (Reaction Unit)

1. **Emotional Shift**: Tracked through the 'emotional_shift' object with 'from' and 'to' states
2. **Processing**: Character internalizes the outcome (reflected in narrative voice)
3. **New Direction**: Decision becomes the goal for the next scene (continuity through scene_ids array)

### 5.3 Line-Level Execution: Scene Components

Scenes are constructed with specific data elements for consistency:

- **Entry Hook**: Opening line or action for immediate reader engagement
- **POV Management**: Tracked through 'pov_character_id' field
- **Narrative Voice**: Specified as enum ('third_person_limited', 'first_person', etc.)
- **Character Presence**: All participants tracked in 'character_ids' array
- **Setting Context**: Location linked through 'setting_id'
- **Summary**: One-sentence description of core action or purpose
- **Emotional Arc**: Tracked from beginning to end state for character development

### 5.4 JSON Data Structure for Scene Object

#### Field Descriptions

**scene_id**: A unique identifier for the scene.

**scene_number**: The sequential number of the scene within the chapter.

**chapter_ref**: Reference to the chapter this scene belongs to.

**character_ids**: An array of character IDs for all characters present or referenced in the scene.

**setting_id**: A link to the specific Setting object where the scene takes place.

**pov_character_id**: The identifier of the character from whose point of view the scene is told.

**narrative_voice**: The narrative perspective (e.g., "third_person_limited", "first_person").

**summary**: A one-sentence description of the scene's core action or purpose.

**entry_hook**: The opening line or action designed to immediately engage the reader.

**goal**: A clear statement of what the point-of-view character wants to achieve in the scene.

**conflict**: The obstacle, internal or external, that prevents the character from easily achieving their goal.

**outcome**: The result of the conflict, typically an enum ('success', 'failure', 'success_with_cost', 'failure_with_discovery'). This outcome drives the plot forward into the next scene.

**emotional_shift**: A description of the change in the POV character's emotional state from the beginning to the end of the scene (e.g., from "hopeful" to "terrified"). This is crucial for tracking character arcs.

#### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "scene": {
    "scene_id": "scene_001",
    "scene_number": 1,
    "chapter_ref": "chap_001",
    "character_ids": ["char_maya_001", "char_elena_002"],
    "setting_id": "setting_elena_apt_001",
    "pov_character_id": "char_maya_001",
    "narrative_voice": "third_person_limited",
    "summary": "Maya arrives for coffee date, finds Elena's door unlocked and apartment empty with signs of struggle",
    "entry_hook": "The door to Elena's apartment stood ajar, a sliver of darkness where warmth should be.",

## Section 8: Procedural Methodology for Narrative Generation

### 8.1 The Iterative Refinement Paradigm

Iterative refinement breaks novel creation into manageable sequential steps following the Snowflake Method: starting with a single sentence and progressively expanding with greater detail at each stage. This approach avoids cognitive overload by building the story layer by layer—from one-sentence premise to paragraph summary, then character profiles and detailed synopsis.

**AI Augmentation Benefits:**

- LLMs serve as brainstorming assistants, not autonomous authors
- Generate multiple options at each narrative layer
- Human creators curate and guide AI output
- Combines AI's rapid generation with human creative selection

### 8.2 The AI-Augmented Snowflake Algorithm

Maps Snowflake Method stages to HNS population with LLM assistance:

#### 8.2.1 Step 1: Core Concept Generation (Story Object)

- **Action**: Create one-sentence summary
- **Target**: Story object fields
- **AI Process**: Generate multiple premise variations under 20 words
- **Human Curation**: Select most compelling premise, define dramatic question and thematic core
- **Output**: Complete Story object with foundational narrative DNA and structural references

**Example LLM Prompt**:

```
Act as an expert novel outliner. Given the rough story idea "a wizard who has lost his magic," generate 5 potential one-sentence premises. Each premise must be under 20 words, introduce a clear protagonist, a core conflict, and hint at the personal stakes involved.
```

#### 8.2.2 Step 2: Act-Level Structuring (Part Objects)

- **Action**: Expand premise to five-sentence paragraph
- **Target**: Part objects (three acts)
- **AI Process**: Structure as "three disasters plus ending"
- **Refinement**: Ensure dramatic flow and segment into three-act structure
- **Output**: Three Part objects with act designations, key narrative beats, and chapter containers

**Example LLM Prompt**:

```
Based on the premise: "[premise]", write a five-sentence summary paragraph for the novel. The first sentence should establish the setup and the protagonist's ordinary world. The next three sentences should each describe a major disaster or turning point that escalates the conflict. The final sentence should describe the story's resolution or ending.
```

#### 8.2.3 Step 3: Character Conception (Character Objects)

- **Action**: Create character profiles from story summary
- **Target**: Character objects
- **AI Process**: Identify protagonist, antagonist, key allies with storylines
- **Enhancement**: Develop psychological complexity and behavioral consistency
- **Output**: Full Character objects with personality profiles, backstories, motivations, and physical descriptions

**Example LLM Prompt**:

```
Analyze the following story summary: "[summary]". Identify the protagonist, the primary antagonist, and one key supporting character. For each character, generate a profile containing:
1. A one-sentence summary of their storyline
2. Their primary goal in the story
3. Their main conflict (what prevents them from reaching their goal)
4. Their epiphany (what they will learn or how they will change)
```

#### 8.2.4 Step 4: Chapter-Level Expansion (Chapter Objects)

- **Action**: Expand each act sentence to full paragraph
- **Target**: Chapter objects
- **AI Process**: Generate 150-word paragraphs ending with complications
- **Plot Development**: Build cohesive escalation with compelling chapter hooks
- **Output**: Chapter objects with summaries, pacing controls, and structured cliffhangers for serialization

**Example LLM Prompt**:

```
Take the following sentence, which represents a major story beat: "[sentence]". Expand this sentence into a full paragraph of approximately 150 words, detailing the key events that occur. The paragraph should end with a significant setback, complication, or disaster for the protagonist.
```

#### 8.2.5 Step 5: Scene Breakdown (Scene Objects)

- **Action**: Break chapters into 3-5 discrete scenes
- **Target**: Scene objects
- **AI Process**: Generate scene descriptions with action, setting, characters
- **Scene Crafting**: Establish goals, conflicts, and emotional progressions
- **Output**: Complete scene-by-scene blueprint with character dynamics, settings, and narrative mechanics

**Example LLM Prompt**:

```
Given the following chapter summary: "[Chapter.summary]". Break this down into a list of 3 to 5 distinct scenes required to tell this part of the story. For each scene, provide a one-sentence description of the key action, the setting, and the characters involved.
```

## Section 9: Validation and Coherence Auditing

### 9.1 The Challenge of Narrative Coherence

A compelling narrative requires absolute coherence—events must follow logical cause-and-effect chains, characters must act consistently with their established personalities, and story world rules must be respected. The risk of incoherence is magnified in procedural or AI-assisted generation.

### 9.2 Dual-System Validation Framework

#### 9.2.1 Narrative State Tracker (Symbolic Validation)

Tracks objective state of story entities using a key-value store:

**Tracked States:**

- Character States: `character_A.status = 'alive'`, `character_B.location = 'castle'`
- Object States: `magic_sword.owner = 'character_A'`, `magic_sword.status = 'intact'`
- Knowledge States: `character_C.knows('secret') = true`
- Relationship States: `relationship(A, B).status = 'allies'`

**Implementation:**

The validation process is integrated directly into the content generation pipeline.

**Pre-Condition Check:** Before generating the prose for a given scene from the HNS, the system runs a series of assertions based on the scene's summary. For a scene summarized as "Character A gives the magic sword to Character B in the castle," the pre-condition checks would include: verifying both characters are alive, confirming both characters are present at the castle location, and asserting that Character A currently owns the magic sword. If any assertion fails, the system flags a continuity error, halting generation and alerting the creator to a logical flaw in the outline.

**Post-Condition Update:** After a scene is successfully validated and generated, the system updates the state tracker based on the scene's outcome. For the example above, the state would be updated to reflect that the magic sword's owner is now Character B, and any relevant knowledge states would be modified to indicate both characters know about the transfer.

#### 9.2.2 LLM Logic & Emotion Auditor (Semantic Validation)

Uses AI to evaluate nuanced narrative coherence:

**Causality Check:**

- Evaluates logical progression between scenes
- Identifies missing steps or logical gaps
- Suggests bridging scenes when needed

**Example Prompt:**

```
You are a narrative logic analyzer.
Scene A Summary: "The detective discovers a muddy boot print at the crime scene."
Scene B Summary: "The detective accuses the well-dressed CEO of the murder."
Is there a clear and believable causal link between Scene A and Scene B? If not, identify the logical gap and suggest a bridging scene or detail that is missing.
```

**Character Consistency Check:**

- Compares character actions against established profile
- Flags out-of-character behavior
- Evaluates psychological plausibility

**Example Prompt:**

```
You are a character consistency expert. Here is a character profile: [character object data].
Here is a scene summary: "Trapped in a collapsing elevator, John calmly picks the lock and leads everyone to safety."
Are John's actions in this scene consistent with his profile? Specifically address his established fears and motivations. Explain your reasoning.
```

**Emotional Arc Check:**

- Tracks emotional progression across scenes
- Identifies unearned emotional shifts
- Ensures organic character development

**Example Prompt:**

```
You are an emotional coherence specialist. In Scene 5, a character's emotional state shifts from "grief-stricken" to "furious." In Scene 6, their emotional state shifts from "furious" to "joyful."
Given the following summaries for Scene 5 and 6: [scene summaries], is this emotional progression believable?
If not, explain why the transition feels unearned and what narrative element might be required to justify it.
```

## Section 10: AI-Powered Narrative Visualization with Gemini

### 10.1 Gemini Prompting Principles

Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model excels at natural language understanding for visual generation. Unlike keyword-based models, Gemini responds best to descriptive, narrative prompts that describe scenes as complete thoughts.

**Core Principle**: Describe the scene, don't list keywords. Use detailed narrative paragraphs rather than disconnected terms.

**Effective Prompt Structure:**

- Subject description with specific details
- Action or pose (for characters)
- Environment and setting context
- Lighting and atmosphere
- Photographic or artistic style references

### 10.2 Character Visualization with Gemini

Gemini maintains character consistency across multiple generations by preserving facial features, distinctive appearance, and clothing details when properly prompted.

#### Initial Character Generation

Transform Character.physical_description into narrative prompts:

**Gemini Character Template:**

```
A photorealistic portrait of [Character.name], a [age]-year-old [ethnicity] person with [build] build.
They have [hair_style_color] and [eye_color] eyes with [facial_features].
Notable features include [distinguishing_marks].
They wear [typical_attire], reflecting their role as [archetype].
Their expression shows [personality.traits[0]] and [personality.traits[1]] personality.
Shot with an 85mm portrait lens, soft natural lighting, professional photography style.
```

#### Maintaining Character Consistency

**Best Practices:**

- Establish detailed character in first prompt with all physical attributes
- Use follow-up prompts to place same character in new contexts
- Include phrase "same character as previously generated" in subsequent prompts
- Store initial generation description in Character.visual_reference_id for reuse
- Restart conversation with full description if features begin to drift

### 10.3 Setting Visualization with Gemini

Gemini excels at atmospheric environment generation when provided with rich sensory details from Setting objects.

**Gemini Environment Template:**

```
A [visual_style] wide establishing shot of [Setting.name]: [Setting.description].
The architecture features [architectural_style] design elements.
The scene shows [sensory.sight[0]] in the foreground and [sensory.sight[1]] in the background.
The atmosphere feels [mood], with [sensory.sound descriptions] implied through visual elements.
Color palette dominated by [color_palette[0]], [color_palette[1]], and [color_palette[2]].
Photographic style inspired by [visual_references[0]].
Wide-angle lens perspective capturing the full environment.
```

**Environmental Details:**

- Use photographic terminology (wide-angle, macro, Dutch angle) for precise control
- Describe lighting naturally: "illuminated by warm sunset light" rather than technical terms
- Include sensory details as visual cues (e.g., "mist suggesting cold air")
- Reference artistic styles conversationally: "in the style of [visual_references]"

## Section 11: Evaluation Framework for Web Novels

### 11.1 Defining Quality for Serialized Fiction

Web novel success prioritizes sustained reader engagement over traditional literary merit. The primary goal is compelling readers to consume the next chapter through effective pacing, conflict escalation, and hooks.

### 11.2 Multi-Axis Evaluation Matrix

The evaluation matrix combines objective data-driven metrics with structured qualitative assessment applied at the chapter level.

#### 11.2.1 Quantitative Metrics

##### 11.2.1.1 Chapter Word Count

- **Definition**: Total number of words in the chapter
- **Measurement**: Automated word count
- **Target Range**: 1,200-2,500 words (optimal for single-session reading and binge consumption)
- **Purpose**: Ensure chapters are long enough to advance plot but short enough for one sitting

##### 11.2.1.2 Pacing Score

- **Definition**: Density of plot-advancing events relative to chapter length
- **Formula**: (Number of Plot-Advancing Scenes) / (Word Count / 1000)
- **Measurement**: Plot-advancing scene = any scene where outcome is not neutral (Success, Failure, Success with cost)
- **Target**: Evaluated against chapter's pacing_goal (Fast chapters need higher scores than Slow chapters)

##### 11.2.1.3 Hook Presence

- **Definition**: Binary check ensuring chapter concludes with deliberate reader retention mechanism
- **Measurement**: 1 if chapter_hook object exists in HNS, 0 if absent
- **Target**: 1 for all chapters (absence is red flag for reader drop-off)
- **Purpose**: Verify structural hook implementation

##### 11.2.1.4 Reader Engagement Score

- **Definition**: Direct measure of audience interaction with published chapter
- **Formula**: (Total Comments + Total Likes) / Total Views
- **Source**: Platform analytics data
- **Purpose**: Track engagement trends over time (sudden drops indicate content issues)

#### 11.2.2 Qualitative Metrics (1-5 Scale with Detailed Rubrics)

##### 11.2.2.1 Plot Coherence & Progression

- **Definition**: Logical consistency of plot within chapter and contribution to overall arc
- **1 (Poor)**: Contains significant plot holes or contradictions; fails to advance main plot or subplots
- **3 (Average)**: Logically consistent but disconnected from main arc or relies on clichés; minimal progression
- **5 (Excellent)**: Seamlessly advances main plot and subplots in logical, compelling way; events are causally linked

##### 11.2.2.2 Character Development & Believability

- **Definition**: Consistency and depth of characterization, particularly for POV character
- **1 (Poor)**: Character contradicts established personality/motivations without justification
- **3 (Average)**: Actions are plausible but internal state unexplored; character feels static
- **5 (Excellent)**: Actions directly result from personality and situation; reveals new depths or advances arc

##### 11.2.2.3 Pacing & Flow

- **Definition**: Subjective assessment of reading rhythm and tempo, independent of calculated Pacing Score
- **1 (Poor)**: Jarringly rushed or painfully slow; ineffective balance of action/dialogue/description
- **3 (Average)**: Generally acceptable but has sections that drag or feel abrupt
- **5 (Excellent)**: Perfectly matches content and pacing_goal; smooth scene flow; engaging narrative balance

##### 11.2.2.4 Hook Effectiveness

- **Definition**: Compelling power of chapter-end hook to drive continued reading
- **1 (Poor)**: Chapter ends abruptly or flat with no incentive to continue
- **3 (Average)**: Hook present but generic or predictable; creates mild curiosity
- **5 (Excellent)**: Surprising, specific hook creating powerful urgency or burning question; impossible not to continue

##### 11.2.2.5 Prose & Style

- **Definition**: Quality of sentence-level writing and stylistic execution
- **1 (Poor)**: Numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or inappropriate genre style
- **3 (Average)**: Technically proficient and clear but lacks distinct voice or evocative language
- **5 (Excellent)**: Clean, evocative prose with confident style matching genre/tone; enhances immersion

### 11.3 Diagnostic Application

#### 11.3.1 Success/Failure Thresholds

**Quantitative Metric Thresholds:**
