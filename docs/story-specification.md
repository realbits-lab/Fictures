# Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS) for Serialized Fiction

## Introduction: A Systems-Oriented Framework

This document provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework for planning, generating, validating, and evaluating serialized fiction. It transforms storytelling from unstructured creative processes into a systematic approach using the "Story as Data" paradigm, enabling procedural generation and AI-assisted narrative creation.

The framework is built on the **Hierarchical Narrative Schema (HNS)**, a four-level data architecture that encapsulates story structure from the highest conceptual level down to individual scenes. This structured representation serves as the foundation for automated validation, AI-powered visualization, and systematic evaluation of narrative quality.

# Story Specification (Level 1: Overall Narrative)

## 1. Definition and Purpose

The **Story** level represents the complete narrative at its most abstract level. It contains the core conceptual DNA of the work, serving as the foundational input for the entire generation process. At this level, writers consider the fundamental premise, core themes, and the ultimate destination of their narrative.

## 2. Key Functions in Planning

- **Central Question Identification**: Define the specific dramatic question your serial will explore over time
- **Character Profile Creation**: Build detailed backgrounds including personality traits, backstories, goals, flaws, and character development arcs
- **World and Setting Design**: Map specific locations, time periods, and cultural context
- **Conflict Architecture**: Establish layered conflicts including overarching story conflict, part-level tensions, and chapter-specific obstacles
- **Message and Meaning**: Identify themes that can develop gradually across serial installments
- **Character Relationship Mapping**: Chart complex relationship dynamics that can evolve across chapters
- **Serial Publication Planning**: Design story structure that accommodates regular publishing schedules and reader feedback
- **Reader Engagement Strategy**: Plan hooks, cliffhangers, and community interaction points

## 3. Story Organization and Part Structure

Before writing, you must decide how to divide your complete story into major parts. This organizational decision shapes your entire narrative approach.

**Common Part Structures:**

**Three-Part Structure (Most Common):**
- **Part I - Setup (25%)**: Establish world, characters, goals, and initial conflicts
- **Part II - Confrontation (50%)**: Escalate stakes, develop complications, build toward climax
- **Part III - Resolution (25%)**: Resolve conflicts, complete character arcs, provide conclusion

**Four-Part Structure (Epic/Complex Narratives):**
- **Part I - Ordinary World**: Introduce protagonist in their normal environment
- **Part II - Journey Begins**: Launch the adventure, establish stakes and obstacles
- **Part III - Crisis and Transformation**: Major setbacks, character growth, pivotal revelations
- **Part IV - Final Challenge**: Climax, resolution, return to changed world

**Five-Part Structure (Classical Drama):**
- **Part I - Exposition**: Introduce characters, setting, background
- **Part II - Rising Action**: Build conflict, develop complications
- **Part III - Climax**: Story's turning point, highest tension
- **Part IV - Falling Action**: Consequences of climax, loose ends addressed
- **Part V - Resolution**: Final outcomes, character fates determined

# Part Specification (Level 2: Major Sections)

## 1. Definition and Purpose

**Parts** represent major thematic or narrative divisions within the overall story. These substantial sections each have their own internal logic, often featuring distinct settings, time periods, or phases of character development. Parts typically correspond to acts in traditional dramatic structure.

## 2. Key Functions in Planning

- **Serial Arc Development**: Structure each part as a satisfying mini-arc within the larger story
- **Reader Engagement Cycles**: Design parts to create natural climax-and-anticipation patterns
- **Character Growth Phases**: Organize character development into distinct stages
- **Community Discussion Points**: Plan major plot developments generating reader speculation
- **Feedback Integration**: Structure parts to allow reader response between major movements
- **Publication Milestones**: Align part conclusions with natural publication breaks
- **Cliffhanger Architecture**: Design part endings creating anticipation for next movement

## 3. Part Planning Framework

**For Each Part, Define:**
- **Central Question**: What major question does this part explore or answer?
- **Character Development**: How do characters change during this section?
- **Plot Development**: What major events or revelations occur?
- **Thematic Focus**: What themes are emphasized in this part?
- **Emotional Journey**: What emotional progression do readers experience?
- **Ending Impact**: How does this part conclude to propel the story forward?

## 4. JSON Data Structure for Part Object

### Field Descriptions

**part_id**: A unique identifier for the part.

**part_title**: A descriptive title for the act (e.g., "Part I: The Setup").

**structural_role**: A string or enum that maps the part to its function within a recognized narrative framework. The most common implementation uses the Three-Act Structure: "Act 1: Setup," "Act 2: Confrontation," and "Act 3: Resolution". This ensures the story follows a proven dramatic arc.

**summary**: A one-paragraph summary describing the main movements and developments within this act.

**key_beats**: An array of strings identifying the crucial plot points contained within this part, based on narrative theory. For "Act 1," this might include "Exposition," "Inciting Incident," and "Plot Point One". For "Act 2," it would include "Rising Action," "Midpoint," and "Plot Point Two." This attribute allows for automated checks to ensure all critical structural elements are present.

**chapters**: An ordered array of chapter_ids that comprise this part of the story.

### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "part": {
    "part_id": "part_001",
    "part_title": "Part I: Discovery",
    "structural_role": "Act 1: Setup",
    "summary": "Dr. Maya Chen's ordinary life shatters when her sister Elena disappears, leaving behind evidence of supernatural research. Despite her skepticism, Maya discovers she has inherited shadow manipulation abilities and must accept training from the mysterious Marcus Webb to save her sister.",
    "key_beats": ["Exposition", "Inciting Incident", "Plot Point One"],
    "chapters": ["chap_001", "chap_002", "chap_003", "chap_004", "chap_005"]
  }
}
```

# Chapter Specification (Level 3: Reading Units)

## 1. Definition and Purpose

The **Chapter** is the primary unit of reader consumption, especially critical in web novel format. Chapters must balance being self-contained reading experiences while advancing the larger narrative. They are designed for serialized release, requiring particular attention to pacing and hooks.

## 2. Key Functions in Planning

- **Reader Session Management**: Each chapter should be consumable in a single reading session (10-20 minutes)
- **Pacing Control**: Modulate narrative tempo through scene selection and prose style
- **Engagement Maintenance**: Every chapter must give readers a reason to continue
- **Character Voice Consistency**: Maintain POV character's perspective throughout
- **Subplot Integration**: Weave multiple story threads while maintaining focus
- **Cliffhanger Engineering**: Design chapter endings that compel continuation
- **Feedback Integration Points**: Natural breaks for reader comments and reactions

## 3. Chapter Structure Framework

**Three-Act Chapter Structure:**

**Setup (20%):**
- Hook readers with opening line or situation
- Establish chapter goal or question
- Orient readers to time, place, and POV

**Confrontation (60%):**
- Develop conflict through escalating complications
- Build tension toward chapter climax
- Integrate character development moments

**Resolution (20%):**
- Reach chapter-level climax
- Provide partial resolution
- Deploy chapter-ending hook

## 4. JSON Data Structure for Chapter Object

### Field Descriptions

**chapter_id**: A unique identifier for the chapter.

**chapter_number**: The sequential number of the chapter within the story.

**chapter_title**: The title of the chapter.

**part_ref**: Reference to the part this chapter belongs to.

**summary**: A detailed, one-paragraph summary of the chapter's events. This corresponds directly to the expanded paragraphs generated in Step 4 of the Snowflake Method, where each sentence of an act's summary is developed into a full paragraph.

**pacing_goal**: An enum ('fast', 'medium', 'slow', 'reflective') that dictates the intended tempo of the chapter. This attribute can be used by a procedural text generator to modulate sentence length, paragraph structure, and the ratio of action to description, ensuring the prose style matches the narrative intent.

**action_dialogue_ratio**: The percentage ratio of action to dialogue (e.g., "40:60").

**chapter_hook**: A structured object designed to formalize the end-of-chapter hook, a critical element for reader retention in serialized fiction. It contains:
- **type**: An enum specifying the nature of the hook (e.g., "revelation", "danger", "decision", "question", "emotional_turning_point").
- **description**: A brief sentence describing the hook itself.
- **urgency_level**: The urgency level of the hook (e.g., "high", "medium", "low").

**scenes**: An ordered array of scene_ids that make up the chapter.

### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "chapter": {
    "chapter_id": "chap_001",
    "chapter_number": 1,
    "chapter_title": "Missing",
    "part_ref": "part_001",
    "summary": "Maya arrives for her weekly coffee date with Elena only to find her sister's apartment unlocked and abandoned. Signs of struggle and a mysterious journal lead Maya to discover Elena was researching something called 'Shadow Keepers' before her disappearance.",
    "pacing_goal": "medium",
    "action_dialogue_ratio": "40:60",
    "chapter_hook": {
      "type": "revelation",
      "description": "Journal's last entry: 'They know about Maya. She has the mark too.'",
      "urgency_level": "high"
    },
    "scenes": ["scene_001", "scene_002", "scene_003"]
  }
}
```

# Scene Specification (Level 4: Individual Scenes)

## 1. The Foundational Principle: A Scene is a Unit of Change

The single most critical principle of scene construction is that a **scene must create meaningful change**. A scene is not defined by its location or duration but by its function: to advance the story. If a scene can be removed without consequence, it is redundant. This change must be tangible, altering a character's situation either externally or internally.

## 2. The Core Architecture: Scene-Sequel Model

Scenes follow the **Scene-Sequel** model, creating an unbreakable chain of cause and effect:

### 2.1. The Scene (Action Unit)

1. **Goal**: POV character enters with specific, immediate objective
2. **Conflict**: Series of escalating obstacles preventing goal achievement
3. **Disaster (Outcome)**: Scene ends with negative outcome or complication
   - "No, and furthermore..." (failure plus new problem)
   - "Yes, but..." (success with unforeseen consequence)

### 2.2. The Sequel (Reaction Unit)

1. **Reaction**: Immediate emotional response to disaster
2. **Dilemma**: Character processes situation and faces difficult choice
3. **Decision**: Character chooses new course, becoming next scene's goal

## 3. Line-Level Execution: Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs)

Scenes should be constructed using **Motivation-Reaction Units** for psychological realism:

- **Motivation (External)**: Observable event happens TO character
- **Reaction (Internal → External)**:
  1. Feeling (involuntary emotion)
  2. Reflex (involuntary action)
  3. Rational action & speech (conscious response)

## 4. JSON Data Structure for Scene Object

### Field Descriptions

**scene_id**: A unique identifier for the scene.

**scene_number**: The sequential number of the scene within the chapter.

**chapter_ref**: Reference to the chapter this scene belongs to.

**character_ids**: An array of character IDs for all characters present or referenced in the scene.

**setting_id**: A link to the specific Setting object where the scene takes place.

**pov_character_id**: The identifier of the character from whose point of view the scene is told.

**narrative_voice**: The narrative perspective (e.g., "third_person_limited", "first_person").

**summary**: A one-sentence description of the scene's core action or purpose.

**entry_hook**: The opening line or action designed to immediately engage the reader.

**goal**: A clear statement of what the point-of-view character wants to achieve in the scene.

**conflict**: The obstacle, internal or external, that prevents the character from easily achieving their goal.

**outcome**: The result of the conflict, typically an enum ('success', 'failure', 'success_with_cost', 'failure_with_discovery'). This outcome drives the plot forward into the next scene.

**emotional_shift**: A description of the change in the POV character's emotional state from the beginning to the end of the scene (e.g., from "hopeful" to "terrified"). This is crucial for tracking character arcs.

### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
  "scene": {
    "scene_id": "scene_001",
    "scene_number": 1,
    "chapter_ref": "chap_001",
    "character_ids": ["char_maya_001", "char_elena_002"],
    "setting_id": "setting_elena_apt_001",
    "pov_character_id": "char_maya_001",
    "narrative_voice": "third_person_limited",
    "summary": "Maya arrives for coffee date, finds Elena's door unlocked and apartment empty with signs of struggle",
    "entry_hook": "The door to Elena's apartment stood ajar, a sliver of darkness where warmth should be.",
    "goal": "Have normal coffee date with Elena",
    "conflict": "Apartment unlocked, Elena missing, signs of struggle",
    "outcome": "failure_with_discovery",
    "emotional_shift": {
      "from": "hopeful",
      "to": "terrified"
    }
  }
}
```

# Validation and Coherence Auditing

## 1. The Challenge of Narrative Coherence

A compelling narrative requires absolute coherence—events must follow logical cause-and-effect chains, characters must act consistently with their established personalities, and story world rules must be respected. The risk of incoherence is magnified in procedural or AI-assisted generation.

## 2. Dual-System Validation Framework

### System 1: Narrative State Tracker (Symbolic Validation)

Tracks objective state of story entities using a key-value store:

**Tracked States:**
- Character States: `character_A.status = 'alive'`, `character_B.location = 'castle'`
- Object States: `magic_sword.owner = 'character_A'`, `magic_sword.status = 'intact'`
- Knowledge States: `character_C.knows('secret') = true`
- Relationship States: `relationship(A, B).status = 'allies'`

**Implementation:**
```yaml
validation_checks:
  pre_conditions:
    - ASSERT(character_A.status == 'alive')
    - ASSERT(character_A.location == scene.location)
    - ASSERT(object.owner == character_A)

  post_conditions:
    - UPDATE(object.owner = character_B)
    - UPDATE(character_A.knows('betrayal') = true)
```

### System 2: LLM Logic & Emotion Auditor (Semantic Validation)

Uses AI to evaluate nuanced narrative coherence:

**Causality Check:**
- Evaluates logical progression between scenes
- Identifies missing steps or logical gaps
- Suggests bridging scenes when needed

**Character Consistency Check:**
- Compares character actions against established profile
- Flags out-of-character behavior
- Evaluates psychological plausibility

**Emotional Arc Check:**
- Tracks emotional progression across scenes
- Identifies unearned emotional shifts
- Ensures organic character development
