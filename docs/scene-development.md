## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Scene Foundation

Converting user input and story context into structured scene concepts that will drive the scene development process.

**1.1 Scene Concept Development**

```yaml
scene_concept_development:
  input:
    chapter_context: "Chapter 1: Missing - Maya arrives at Elena's apartment for their weekly coffee date"
    character_states:
      maya_chen:
        emotional_state: "casual_expectation"
        physical_location: "outside_apartment_building"
        narrative_goal: "normal_sisterly_visit"
      elena_chen:
        emotional_state: "absent_mysterious"
        physical_location: "unknown"
        narrative_function: "catalyst_through_absence"
    setting_parameters:
      primary_location: "residential_street_outside_apartment"
      time_context: "sunday_morning_10am"
      atmosphere_target: "routine_to_worried_progression"

  process:
    - analyze_scene_purpose: "Determine scene's narrative function within chapter"
    - establish_character_goals: "Define what each character wants in this moment"
    - identify_obstacles: "Determine what prevents easy goal achievement"
    - plan_outcome_impact: "Define how scene resolution affects story progression"

  output:
    scene_foundation:
      order: 1
      title: "Normal Morning"
      narrative_purpose: "establish_inciting_incident"
      viewpoint_character: "maya_chen"
      scene_goal: "maya_attempts_routine_visit_discovers_mystery"
      primary_conflict: "expectations_versus_reality"
      emotional_arc: "casual_comfort_to_growing_concern"
      story_function: "transition_from_normal_world_to_adventure"
      scene_stakes: "maya_peace_of_mind_and_family_connection"
```

```
[Analyze Purpose] ──→ [Character Goals] ──→ [Identify Obstacles] ──→ [Plan Impact]
```

### Phase 2: Scene Construction

Implementing the detailed scene architecture using the Scene Planning Framework elements.

**2.1 Scene Structure Development**

```yaml
scene_structure_process:
  input:
    scene_foundation:
      order: 1
      title: "Normal Morning"
      narrative_purpose: "establish_inciting_incident"
      viewpoint_character: "maya_chen"
      scene_goal: "maya_attempts_routine_visit_discovers_mystery"
      primary_conflict: "expectations_versus_reality"
      emotional_arc: "casual_comfort_to_growing_concern"
      story_function: "transition_from_normal_world_to_adventure"
      scene_stakes: "maya_peace_of_mind_and_family_connection"

  process:
    - establish_entry_point: "Determine optimal scene opening for maximum impact"
    - map_progression_beats: "Structure scene development through conflict escalation"
    - plan_sensory_grounding: "Identify key environmental and physical details"
    - design_exit_strategy: "Create compelling scene conclusion and transition"

  output:
    scene_structure:
      pre_scene_planning:
        - "The scene occurs outside Elena's apartment building on a quiet residential street during Sunday morning at 10 AM, with Maya Chen as POV character while Elena is absent but present through environmental traces."
        - "The scene begins with casual, routine expectations but gradually builds to worried concern as Maya's peace of mind and family connection become threatened by the mystery of Elena's safety."
      scene_execution:
        - "The scene begins with Maya arriving at Elena's building and checking her phone, grounded by sensory details like Elena's parked car, echoing knocks, and the weight of the spare key."
        - "The scene uses minimal external dialogue, focusing on Maya's internal voice and one-sided conversation, while maintaining a deliberate build from routine normalcy to growing concern."
      post_scene_evaluation:
        - "Maya fails to achieve her goal of a normal visit with Elena, but this failure becomes the story's inciting incident while revealing her protective and persistent nature."
        - "The mystery is established and Maya's investigation is launched, moving from normal world into supernatural territory while creating a compelling hook through Maya's growing unease."
```

**3.1 Dialogue Enhancement Integration**

```yaml
dialogue_enhancement_process:
  input:
    scene_structure:
      pre_scene_planning:
        - "The scene occurs outside Elena's apartment building on a quiet residential street during Sunday morning at 10 AM, with Maya Chen as POV character while Elena is absent but present through environmental traces."
        - "The scene begins with casual, routine expectations but gradually builds to worried concern as Maya's peace of mind and family connection become threatened by the mystery of Elena's safety."
      scene_execution:
        - "The scene begins with Maya arriving at Elena's building and checking her phone, grounded by sensory details like Elena's parked car, echoing knocks, and the weight of the spare key."
        - "The scene uses minimal external dialogue, focusing on Maya's internal voice and one-sided conversation, while maintaining a deliberate build from routine normalcy to growing concern."

  process:
    - enhance_character_voice: "Ensure authentic dialogue patterns and speech markers"
    - build_tension_through_conversation: "Use dialogue rhythm to escalate scene conflict"
    - integrate_subtext: "Layer deeper meanings beneath surface conversation"
    - maintain_scene_pacing: "Balance dialogue with action and description"

  output:
    dialogue_authenticity:
      internal_monologue_patterns:
        maya_voice_markers: ["protective_concern", "artistic_observation", "practical_problem_solving"]
        authenticity_score: 0.92

        tension_building: "gradual_worry_escalation"
        pacing_rhythm: "deliberate_measured_progression"

  process:
    - ground_environmental_details: "Establish vivid setting through sensory information"
    - integrate_character_physicality: "Show character state through physical actions"
    - enhance_atmospheric_mood: "Use sensory details to support emotional progression"
    - maintain_viewpoint_consistency: "Filter all sensory information through POV character"

  output:
    immersive_quality:

3. **Sensory Grounding**: Anchor readers in scene through vivid environmental details
4. **Emotional Progression**: Create clear emotional arc from scene beginning to end

### AI Collaboration

1. **Context-Rich Scene Prompting**: Provide comprehensive character and story context for AI generation
2. **Iterative Enhancement**: Use AI as collaborative partner for dialogue, description, and pacing refinement
3. **Authenticity Preservation**: Maintain character voice consistency while leveraging AI capabilities
4. **Quality Validation**: Regularly assess AI-enhanced content against established scene standards

### Quality Management

1. **Scene Coherence Monitoring**: Ensure internal scene logic and character behavior consistency
