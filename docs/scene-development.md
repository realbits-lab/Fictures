# Scene Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the systematic approach to developing individual scenes within the Fictures platform, building upon the core principle that **every scene must create meaningful change** through a Goal-Conflict-Outcome structure. It integrates the Scene-Sequel cycle from established narrative theory while leveraging AI assistance for enhanced scene-level writing workflows.

## Core Scene Architecture

**The Scene-Sequel Development Cycle:**

Every effective scene follows the fundamental **Goal-Conflict-Outcome** structure, creating meaningful change through a **Value Shift**:

```
┌─── THE SCENE (Action Unit) ───┐        ┌─── THE SEQUEL (Reaction Unit) ───┐
│                               │        │                                  │
│  GOAL ────┐                   │        │  REACTION ────┐                  │
│           │                   │        │               │                  │
│           ▼                   │   ──►  │               ▼                  │
│  CONFLICT │                   │        │  DILEMMA ─────┼──► Next Scene    │
│           │                   │        │               │                  │
│           ▼                   │        │               ▼                  │
│  DISASTER (Outcome)           │        │  DECISION ────┘                  │
│                               │        │                                  │
└───────────────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────────────┘

VALUE SHIFT: Character moves from one polarity to opposite (+ to -, - to +, or escalating)
TURNING POINT: The specific moment that irrevocably alters the scene's direction

## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Essential Scene Planning

**Scene Planning Process:**

```
[Define Goal] ──→ [Identify Conflict] ──→ [Plan Outcome] ──→ [Map Value Shift]
```

Convert user input into the canonical scene specification format, focusing on the core Goal-Conflict-Outcome structure.

**1.1 Scene Foundation Development**

```yaml
# Using the canonical scene specification format
scene:
  id: 1
  summary: "Maya arrives for coffee date, finds Elena missing with signs of struggle"
  
  # Scene context
  time: "sunday_10:05am"
  place: "elena_apartment_hallway"
  pov: "maya"
  
  # Characters present
  characters:
    maya: { enters: "casual_anticipation", exits: "panicked_determination" }
    elena: { status: "absent_but_referenced", evidence: "struggle_signs" }
  
  # Core dramatic movement (Goal-Conflict-Outcome)
  goal: "Normal coffee date with Elena"
  obstacle: "Door unlocked, apartment silent, struggle evidence"
  outcome: "Realizes Elena in danger, decides to search"
  
  # Key beats that must happen
  beats:
    - "Maya knocks, no answer, tries door"
    - "Finds apartment unlocked, calls Elena's name"
    - "Discovers overturned table, broken coffee mug"
    - "Maya panics, decides to search rather than call police"
  
  # Emotional/value shift
  shift: "routine_expectation → urgent_fear"
  
  # Connection to chapter flow
  leads_to: "maya_searches_apartment_for_clues"
  
  # Visual scene description
  image_prompt: "Young woman in casual clothes standing in a dimly lit apartment hallway, her face showing concern as she looks at an ajar door. The scene suggests early morning light filtering through windows, with subtle signs of disturbance visible - an overturned coffee table and scattered items in the background. Mood: tense, mysterious, domestic thriller atmosphere."
```

**Scene Planning Process:**

```
[Define Goal] ──→ [Identify Conflict] ──→ [Plan Outcome] ──→ [Map Value Shift]
```

### Step 2: Scene Structure and Execution

**MRU Structure Process:**

```
[Write MRU Sequence] ──→ [Check Natural Flow] ──→ [Validate Cause-Effect] ──→ [Balance Scene/Summary]
```

Implementing the scene using line-level writing techniques that ensure immersive, psychologically real prose.

**2.1 Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs)**

Structure scene prose using the natural sequence of stimulus and response:

```
MOTIVATION (External Event) ──→ REACTION (Character Response)
                                     │
                                     ├── 1. Feeling (Internal/Emotional)
                                     ├── 2. Reflex (Physical/Involuntary)  
                                     └── 3. Action/Speech (Deliberate)

Example:
Motivation: "The door slammed shut." (External, objective)
Reaction:   
  Feeling: "Fear shot through him." (Internal response)
  Reflex:  "He flinched." (Physical response)
  Action:  "He reached for the doorknob. 'Who's there?'" (Deliberate response)
```

**2.2 Scene vs. Summary Balance**

Control pacing through strategic use of real-time dramatization versus time compression:

- **Scene ("Showing")**: Dramatize turning points, key interactions, emotional moments
- **Summary ("Telling")**: Compress transitions, backstory, routine actions

### Step 3: AI-Enhanced Scene Writing

**AI Enhancement Process:**

```
[Context Building] ──→ [AI Generation] ──→ [Voice Integration] ──→ [Quality Assurance]
```

Leverage AI tools for dialogue authenticity, sensory immersion, and scene coherence while maintaining the core Goal-Conflict-Outcome structure.

**3.1 AI-Assisted Content Enhancement**

Use AI functions to enhance scene elements while preserving narrative structure:

```yaml
# AI Enhancement Workflow
scene_enhancement:
  context_building:
    buildSceneContext(chapter_position): "Assembles complete narrative context"
    getCharacterEmotions(scene_id): "Retrieves character emotional states"
    getEnvironmentalDetails(setting): "Identifies relevant atmospheric elements"
  
  content_generation:
    enhanceDialogueTension(characters, conflict): "Improves dialogue authenticity"
    developSensoryImmersion(setting, pov): "Enhances environmental details"
    balanceSceneElements(dialogue, action, description): "Optimizes component distribution"
  
  quality_assurance:
    validateSceneCoherence(scene_content): "Checks internal consistency"
    verifyCharacterContinuity(character_states): "Confirms behavior authenticity"
    assessNarrativeFlow(scene_sequence): "Evaluates scene connections"
```

**3.2 Dialogue and Subtext Development**

Focus on authentic character voice while building tension through conversation:

- **Character Voice Consistency**: Maintain speech patterns and personality markers
- **Subtext Integration**: Layer deeper meanings beneath surface conversation
- **Tension Escalation**: Use dialogue rhythm to build toward scene's turning point
- **MRU Integration**: Ensure dialogue follows natural motivation-reaction patterns

### Step 4: Scene Validation and Quality Assurance

**Scene Validation Process:**

```
[Verify Value Shift] ──→ [Check Character Consistency] ──→ [Assess Story Integration] ──→ [Validate Quality Gates]
```

Ensure the scene achieves its narrative purpose and maintains story coherence.

**4.1 Core Scene Validation Checklist**

Verify the scene meets essential requirements:

```
✓ VALUE SHIFT: Character moved from one polarity to opposite (routine → fear)
✓ GOAL CLARITY: Maya's objective was clear (normal coffee date)
✓ CONFLICT ESCALATION: Obstacles prevented easy achievement (empty apartment, signs of struggle)  
✓ DISASTER OUTCOME: Scene ended with negative result (Elena missing, Maya panicked)
✓ TURNING POINT: Specific moment altered scene direction (discovering struggle signs)
✓ CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Maya's actions align with established personality
✓ MRU STRUCTURE: Prose follows natural motivation-reaction sequence
✓ SCENE FUNCTION: Advances story and develops character effectively
```

**4.2 Quality Gates Assessment**

Use AI functions to validate scene quality:

- `validateSceneCoherence()`: Check internal logic and consistency
- `verifyCharacterContinuity()`: Confirm authentic character behavior  
- `assessNarrativeFlow()`: Evaluate connection to surrounding scenes
- Ensure `image_prompt` captures scene's visual essence and atmosphere

**4.3 Connection to Chapter Flow**

Verify scene serves its function within chapter structure:
- Scene creates meaningful change that affects subsequent scenes
- Character emotional state changes drive next scene's conflict
- Established story threads connect logically to chapter progression

## Scene Architecture Reference

### Scene Function Types

Based on narrative purpose within story structure:

- **Opening Scenes**: Hook establishment, character introduction, world grounding
- **Transition Scenes**: Plot advancement, location changes, time progression  
- **Conflict Scenes**: Tension escalation, character confrontation, obstacle introduction
- **Revelation Scenes**: Information disclosure, mystery resolution, plot twist delivery
- **Emotional Scenes**: Character development, relationship dynamics, internal processing
- **Action Scenes**: Physical conflicts, chase sequences, dynamic interactions
- **Closing Scenes**: Resolution delivery, setup for continuation, emotional satisfaction

### Core Scene Structure

Every scene must contain these essential elements:

**The Scene (Action Unit):**
1. **Goal**: Character's specific, immediate objective
2. **Conflict**: Progressive complications preventing easy achievement
3. **Disaster**: Negative outcome ("No, and..." or "Yes, but...")

**The Sequel (Reaction Unit):**
1. **Reaction**: Immediate emotional response to disaster
2. **Dilemma**: Processing new situation, no easy options
3. **Decision**: Choice of new course of action (becomes next scene's Goal)

### Scene Pacing Control

- **Fast-Paced**: Action sequences, conflict moments, revelation scenes (use Scene)
- **Medium-Paced**: Character development, plot advancement, world-building (balance Scene/Summary)
- **Slow-Paced**: Reflection moments, aftermath processing (use Sequel/Summary)

## AI Integration Functions

**Context Building**
- `buildSceneContext(chapterPosition)`: Assembles complete narrative context
- `getCharacterEmotions(sceneId)`: Retrieves current character emotional states
- `getEnvironmentalDetails(setting)`: Identifies relevant atmospheric elements

**Content Generation**

## Best Practices

### Core Scene Principles

1. **Every Scene Must Create Change**: No scene should be removable without consequence
2. **Value Shift Focus**: Move character from one polarity to opposite through turning point
3. **Goal-Driven Structure**: Character enters with clear objective, faces escalating conflict
4. **Disaster Endings**: End with "No, and..." or "Yes, but..." to drive story forward

### Line-Level Writing

1. **MRU Consistency**: Maintain natural motivation-reaction sequence in prose
2. **Sensory Grounding**: Anchor readers through viewpoint character's sensory experience  
3. **Scene/Summary Balance**: Dramatize crucial moments, compress routine transitions
4. **Character Voice**: Maintain authentic speech patterns and personality markers

### AI Collaboration

1. **Structure First**: Establish Goal-Conflict-Outcome before AI enhancement
2. **Context-Rich Prompting**: Provide complete character and story context
3. **Preserve Authenticity**: Use AI to enhance, not replace, character voice consistency
4. **Validate Against Standards**: Check AI content against scene quality gates

### Quality Assurance

1. **Canonical Format**: Use specified YAML structure including `image_prompt`
2. **Chapter Integration**: Ensure scene serves function within larger chapter arc
3. **Character Continuity**: Verify behavior aligns with established personality
4. **Story Advancement**: Confirm scene progresses plot and develops character effectively
