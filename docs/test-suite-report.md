### Failed Test Details

**Test:** TC-NOVELS-REDIRECT-002: Logo link navigates to home and redirects to novels

**Error:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: true
Received: false

Line: gnb-novels.e2e.spec.ts:130:48
expect(currentUrl.includes('/novels')).toBe(true);
```

**Issue:** After clicking the logo link from the `/community` page, the navigation did not redirect to `/novels` as expected. The URL did not contain '/novels' after the click event.

**Artifacts:**
- Screenshot: `test-results/.../test-failed-1.png`
- Video: `test-results/.../video.webm`
- Error Context: `test-results/.../error-context.md`

**Recommendation:** Investigate logo link click behavior and ensure proper navigation handling for home link clicks.

## Recommendations

### 1. Test Data Management
- **Issue:** Many tests skip assertions due to empty database (0 stories)
- **Action:** Implement test data seeding before test execution
- **Benefit:** Enable full story interaction testing

### 2. Fix Failed Logo Navigation Test
- **Issue:** Logo click doesn't redirect to /novels (TC-NOVELS-REDIRECT-002 failed)
- **Action:** Review GlobalNavigation component logo click handler
- **File:** `src/components/layout/GlobalNavigation.tsx`

### 3. Run Full Test Suite
- **Current:** Only gnb-novels.e2e.spec.ts executed
- **Action:** Execute remaining 3 test files:
  - gnb-community.e2e.spec.ts (13 tests)
  - gnb-studio.e2e.spec.ts (11 tests)
  - gnb-publish-analytics-settings.e2e.spec.ts (16 tests)
- **Benefit:** Complete test coverage validation

### 4. Authentication Testing
- **Status:** `.auth/user.json` configured
- **Action:** Verify authenticated user workflows in Studio, Publish, Analytics, Settings
- **Benefit:** Ensure role-based access control works correctly

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Current:** Novels page loads in 1.2 seconds ✅
- **Target:** Maintain < 3 seconds for all pages
- **Monitor:** Watch for performance regression as stories are added
