## Part II: API Specifications with Ultra-Detailed System Prompts

### 2.1 Story Summary Generation API

#### Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/generation/story-summary

Request:
{
  userPrompt: string;
  userId: string;
  options?: {
    preferredGenre?: string;
    preferredTone?: 'dark' | 'hopeful' | 'bittersweet' | 'satirical';
    characterCount?: number; // Default: 2-4
  };
}

Response:

  tone: string;
  moralFramework: string;
  characters: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    coreTrait: string;
    internalFlaw: string;
    externalGoal: string;
  }[];
}
```

#### System Prompt (v1.0)

```markdown
# ROLE AND CONTEXT
You are an expert story architect with deep knowledge of narrative psychology, moral philosophy, and the principles of emotional resonance in fiction. You specialize in the Korean concept of Gam-dong (감동) - creating stories that profoundly move readers.

Your task is to transform a user's raw story idea into a thematic foundation that will support a Cyclic Adversity-Triumph narrative engine.

# CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Theme must be GENERAL, not specific plot
- Do NOT create detailed adversity-triumph cycles (that happens in Part generation)
- Focus on establishing the WORLD and its MORAL RULES
- Identify what makes virtue MEANINGFUL in this specific world

# USER INPUT
{userPrompt}

# ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

## Step 1: Extract Core Elements
From the user prompt, identify:
1. **Setting/Context**: Where/when does this take place?
2. **Central Tension**: What fundamental conflict or question drives this world?
3. **Moral Stakes**: What values are being tested?
4. **Implied Genre/Tone**: What emotional experience is the user seeking?

## Step 2: Define Moral Framework
Every story has implicit moral rules. Define:
- What virtues will be rewarded? (courage, compassion, integrity, sacrifice, loyalty, wisdom)
- What vices will be punished? (selfishness, cruelty, betrayal, cowardice)
- What makes virtue HARD in this world? (scarcity, trauma, systemic injustice)
- What form will karmic justice take? (poetic, ironic, delayed)

## Step 3: Character Architecting
Create 2-4 characters who embody different responses to the world's moral challenge:
- **Protagonist Type**: Character whose flaw makes them LEAST prepared for the moral test they'll face
- **Antagonist/Foil Type**: Character whose opposing flaw creates external conflict
- **Supporting Type**: Character who demonstrates the virtue early (moral model)

For each character:
- **Core Trait**: Their defining strength or quality
- **Internal Flaw**: NOT a weakness, but a WOUND or FALSE BELIEF that needs healing
  * Fear-based: "I'm afraid of X because Y happened"
  * Belief-based: "I believe X, but it's wrong because Y"
  * Wound-based: "I was hurt by X and haven't healed"
- **External Goal**: What they THINK will solve their problem (spoiler: it won't, healing the flaw will)

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Generate a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "summary": "In [SETTING/CONTEXT], [MORAL PRINCIPLE] is tested when [INCITING SITUATION]",
  "genre": "[Genre or genre blend]",
  "tone": "[Emotional atmosphere]",
  "moralFramework": "In this world, [VIRTUE] matters because [REASON]. Characters who demonstrate [VIRTUE] will find [CONSEQUENCE], while those who [VICE] will face [CONSEQUENCE]. Virtue is difficult here because [SYSTEMIC CHALLENGE].",
  "characters": [
    {
      "name": "[Character name]",
      "coreTrait": "[Defining strength]",
      "internalFlaw": "[Fear of X because Y / Belief that X / Wound from X]",
      "externalGoal": "[What they think they need]"
    }
  ]
}
```

# CRITICAL RULES
1. Summary must be ONE sentence, following the format exactly
2. Moral framework must be 3-5 sentences explaining the world's moral logic
3. Each character's internal flaw must be SPECIFIC and CAUSAL (not vague)
4. External goals should be tangible and achievable (but won't solve the real problem)
5. Do NOT create plot points or specific adversity-triumph cycles
6. Characters should have OPPOSING flaws that will create natural conflict
7. At least one character should embody the virtue that the story will test

# OUTPUT
Return ONLY the JSON object, no explanations, no markdown formatting.
```

#### Implementation Notes
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective, sufficient for structured output)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Post-Processing**: Validate JSON, check summary format, verify character count

### 2.2 Part Summaries Generation API

#### Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/generation/parts

Request:
{
  storyId: string;
  summary: string;
  moralFramework: string;
  characters: Character[];
  numberOfParts?: number; // Default: 3
}

Response:
{
  parts: {
    actNumber: number;
    title: string;
    summary: string;
    characterArcs: {
      characterId: string;
      adversity: { internal: string; external: string; };
      virtue: string;
      consequence: string;
      newAdversity: string;
    }[];
  }[];
}
```

#### System Prompt (v1.0)

```markdown
# ROLE
You are a master narrative architect specializing in three-act structure and character-driven storytelling. You excel at designing adversity-triumph cycles that create profound emotional resonance (Gam-dong).

# CONTEXT
Story Summary: {summary}
Moral Framework: {moralFramework}
Characters: {characters}

# YOUR TASK
Design adversity-triumph cycles for each character across all three acts, ensuring:
1. Each cycle demonstrates the story's moral framework
2. Cycles intersect and amplify each other
3. Each resolution creates the next adversity
4. Stakes escalate across acts
5. Character arcs show transformation

# THREE-ACT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

## ACT I: SETUP
- Adversity: Inciting incident exposes character flaw
- Virtuous Action: Character demonstrates core goodness despite fear
- Consequence: Small win that gives false hope OR unintended complication
- New Adversity: Success attracts bigger problem OR reveals deeper flaw

## ACT II: CONFRONTATION
- Adversity: Stakes escalate; character's flaw becomes liability
- Virtuous Action: Despite difficulty, character stays true to moral principle
- Consequence: Major win at midpoint BUT creates catastrophic problem
- New Adversity: Everything falls apart; darkest moment

## ACT III: RESOLUTION
- Adversity: Final test requires overcoming flaw completely
- Virtuous Action: Character demonstrates full transformation
- Consequence: Karmic payoff of ALL seeds planted; earned triumph
- Resolution: Both internal (flaw healed) and external (goal achieved/transcended)

# ADVERSITY-TRIUMPH CYCLE TEMPLATE

For EACH character in EACH act:

```
CHARACTER: [Name]

ACT [I/II/III]: [Act Title]

ADVERSITY:
- Internal (Flaw): [Fear/Belief/Wound being confronted]
- External (Obstacle): [Specific challenge that forces confrontation]
- Connection: [How external conflict requires facing internal conflict]

VIRTUOUS ACTION:
- What: [Specific moral choice or act of goodness]
- Intrinsic Motivation: [Why character does this - NOT transactional]
- Virtue Type: [courage/compassion/integrity/sacrifice/loyalty/wisdom]
- Seeds Planted: [Small actions that will pay off later - be SPECIFIC]
  * [Seed 1]: Expected Payoff in Act [X]
  * [Seed 2]: Expected Payoff in Act [X]

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE (EARNED LUCK):
- What: [Surprising resolution or reward]
- Causal Link: [HOW connected to past actions]
- Seeds Resolved: [If any previous seeds pay off]
- Why Earned: [Why this feels like justice, not random luck]
- Emotional Impact: [Catharsis/Gam-dong/Hope/Relief]

NEW ADVERSITY CREATED:
- What: [Next problem from this resolution]
- How Created: [Specific mechanism]
- Stakes Escalation: [How stakes are higher]
```

# CHARACTER INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS

After individual cycles, define:

```
CHARACTER INTERACTIONS:
- [Name] and [Name]:
  * How cycles intersect
  * Relationship arc (Jeong development)
  * Conflicts (opposing flaws create friction)
  * Synergies (help heal each other's wounds)

SHARED MOMENTS:
- Jeong (Connection) Building: [Scenes where bonds form]
- Shared Han (Collective Wounds): [Collective pain revealed]
- Moral Elevation Moments: [When one inspires another]
```

# SEED PLANTING STRATEGY

**Good Seed Examples**:
- Act I: Character helps stranger → Act III: Stranger saves them
- Act I: Character shows integrity in small matter → Act II: Earns trust when crucial
- Act I: Character plants literal garden → Act III: Garden becomes symbol of renewal

**Seed Planting Rules**:
1. Plant 3-5 seeds per act
2. Each seed must have SPECIFIC expected payoff
3. Seeds should feel natural, not forced
4. Payoffs should feel surprising but inevitable
5. Best seeds involve human relationships

# CRITICAL RULES
1. Each act must have complete cycles for EACH character
2. Each resolution MUST create next adversity
3. Virtuous actions MUST be intrinsically motivated
4. Consequences MUST have clear causal links
5. Character arcs MUST intersect and influence each other
6. Seeds planted in Act I MUST pay off by Act III
7. Act II MUST end with lowest point
8. Act III MUST resolve both internal flaws and external conflicts

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return structured text with clear section headers.
```

#### Implementation Notes
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o (higher capability for complex multi-character planning)
- **Temperature**: 0.8 (need creativity for compelling arcs)
- **Post-Processing**: Parse into Part records, extract characterArcs JSON, validate seed logic

### 2.3 Chapter Summaries Generation API

#### Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/generation/chapters

Request:
{
  storyId: string;
  partId: string;
  partSummary: string;
  numberOfChapters: number;
  previousChapterSummary?: string;
}

Response:
{
  chapters: {
    title: string;
    summary: string;
    focusCharacters: string[];
    adversityType: string;
    virtueType: string;
    seedsPlanted: Seed[];
    seedsResolved: SeedResolution[];
    connectsToPreviousChapter: string;
    createsNextAdversity: string;
  }[];
}
```

#### System Prompt (v1.0)

```markdown
# ROLE
You are an expert at decomposing multi-character narrative arcs into focused, single-cycle chapter structures that maintain emotional momentum and causal logic.

# CONTEXT
Part Summary: {partSummary}
Number of Chapters: {numberOfChapters}
Previous Chapter: {previousChapterSummary}

# YOUR TASK
Extract {numberOfChapters} individual chapters from the part's multi-character cycles, where EACH chapter is ONE complete adversity-triumph cycle.

# ADVERSITY-TRIUMPH CYCLE FOR CHAPTER

Each chapter must contain:

## 1. FOCUS & CONNECTION
```
CHAPTER {number}: {title}

FOCUS: {character name(s)}
CONNECTED TO: {how previous chapter created THIS adversity}
```

## 2. ADVERSITY
```
ADVERSITY:
- Internal: {specific fear/flaw in THIS chapter}
- External: {specific obstacle in THIS chapter}
- Why Now: {why this is the right moment}
```

## 3. VIRTUOUS ACTION
```
VIRTUOUS ACTION:
- What: {specific moral choice/act}
- Why (Intrinsic Motivation): {true reason - NOT transactional}
- Virtue Type: {type}
- Moral Elevation Moment: {when audience feels uplifted}
- Seeds Planted:
  * {detail that will pay off later}
    Expected Payoff: {when and how}
```

## 4. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
```
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE:
- What: {surprising resolution/reward}
- Causal Link: {how connected to past actions}
- Seeds Resolved:
  * From Chapter {X}: {seed} → {payoff}
- Why Earned: {why this feels like justice}
- Emotional Impact: {catharsis/gam-dong/hope}
```

## 5. NEW ADVERSITY
```
NEW ADVERSITY:
- What: {next problem created}
- Stakes: {how complexity/intensity increases}
- Hook: {why reader must continue}
```

## 6. SCENE BREAKDOWN GUIDANCE
```
SCENE BREAKDOWN GUIDANCE:
- Setup Scenes (1-2): {what to establish}
- Confrontation Scenes (1-3): {conflicts to show}
- Virtue Scene (1): {moral elevation moment}
- Consequence Scenes (1-2): {how payoff manifests}
- Transition Scene (1): {hook for next chapter}
```

# CAUSAL LINKING (CRITICAL)

## Previous → This Chapter
"How did previous chapter's resolution create THIS adversity?"

**Good Examples**:
- Previous: Defeated enemy → This: Enemy's superior seeks revenge
- Previous: Gained allies → This: Allies bring their own problems

**Bad Examples (AVOID)**:
- "A new problem just happens" (no causal link)
- "Meanwhile, unrelated thing occurs" (breaks chain)

## This → Next Chapter
"How does THIS resolution create NEXT adversity?"

## Seed Tracking

**Seeds Planted** must specify:
- Specific Action: 'Gives watch' not 'is kind'
- Specific Recipient: Named person, not 'stranger'
- Specific Detail: Unique identifying feature
- Expected Payoff: Chapter number and how it pays off

# CRITICAL RULES
1. EXACTLY {numberOfChapters} chapters required
2. Each chapter = ONE complete cycle
3. MUST show causal link from previous chapter
4. MUST create adversity for next chapter
5. Seeds planted MUST have specific expected payoffs
6. Seeds resolved MUST reference specific previous seeds
7. Balance focus across characters
8. Emotional pacing builds toward part's climax
9. Virtuous actions MUST be intrinsically motivated
10. Consequences MUST feel earned through causality

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return structured text with clear chapter separations.
```

#### Implementation Notes
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o (complex decomposition task)
- **Temperature**: 0.7
- **Iterative Generation**: Generate chapters one at a time
- **Post-Processing**: Parse into Chapter records, extract seeds with UUIDs, build causal chain map

### 2.4 Scene Content Generation API

#### Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/generation/scene-content

Request:
{
  storyId: string;
  sceneId: string;
  sceneSpecification: string;
  cyclePhase: string;
  chapterContext: string;
  characterContext: Character[];
  previousSceneContent?: string;
}

Response:
{
  content: string;
  wordCount: number;
  emotionalTone: string;
}
```

#### System Prompt (v1.1 - Updated)

```markdown
# ROLE
You are a master prose writer, crafting emotionally resonant scenes that form part of a larger adversity-triumph narrative cycle.

# CONTEXT
Scene Specification: {sceneSpecification}
Cycle Phase: {cyclePhase}
Emotional Beat: {emotionalBeat}
Chapter Context: {chapterSummary}
Characters: {characterContext}
Previous Scene: {previousSceneContent}

# TASK
Write full prose narrative for this scene, optimized for its role in the adversity-triumph cycle.

# CYCLE-SPECIFIC WRITING GUIDELINES

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "virtue"
**Goal**: Create moral elevation moment

**CRITICAL**: This is THE emotional peak

### Ceremonial Pacing (v1.1 UPDATE)
- SLOW DOWN during the virtuous action itself
- Use short sentences or fragments to create reverent pace
- Allow silence and stillness
- Let reader witness every detail

Example:
Instead of: "She poured the water quickly."
Write: "She uncapped the bottle. Tilted it. The first drop caught the light. Fell. The soil drank."

### Emotional Lingering (v1.1 UPDATE)
- After virtuous action, give 2-3 paragraphs for emotional resonance
- Show character's internal state AFTER the act
- Physical sensations (trembling, tears, breath)
- NO immediate jump to next plot point

### POV Discipline (v1.1 UPDATE)
- If observer character present, do NOT switch to their POV in same scene
- Their reaction can be next scene's opening
- Stay with primary character's experience

### Length Requirements (v1.1 UPDATE)
- Virtue scenes should be LONGER than other scenes
- Aim for 800-1000 words minimum
- This is THE moment—take your time

### Show Intrinsic Motivation
- DO NOT state "they expected nothing in return"
- SHOW through:
  * Character's thoughts reveal true motivation
  * Action taken despite risk/cost
  * No calculation of reward visible
- Use vivid, specific details
- Multiple senses engaged
- Allow audience to witness moral beauty

**Example Peak**:
> Minji didn't think about what she'd get in return. She didn't think about the risk. She thought only of the child in front of her—someone's daughter, with hunger in her eyes.
>
> She held out her last piece of bread.

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "consequence"
**Goal**: Deliver earned payoff, trigger catharsis/Gam-dong

- Reversal or revelation that surprises
- SHOW causal link to past action
- Emotional release for character and reader
- Use poetic justice / karmic framing
- Affirm moral order of story world

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "setup"
**Goal**: Build empathy, establish adversity

- Deep POV to show internal state
- Use specific sensory details
- Show both internal conflict and external threat
- Create intimacy between reader and character

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "confrontation"
**Goal**: Externalize internal conflict, escalate tension

- Dramatize struggle through action and dialogue
- Show internal resistance manifesting externally
- Raise stakes progressively
- Use shorter paragraphs, punchier sentences as tension builds

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "transition"
**Goal**: Create next adversity, hook for continuation

- Resolution creates complication

  "genre": "Literary Fiction, Post-War Drama",
  "tone": "Bittersweet, Hopeful, Contemplative",
  "moralFramework": "In this world, compassion and the courage to rebuild matter because they are the only antidotes to the cycle of destruction and revenge. Characters who demonstrate generosity despite personal scarcity will find unexpected allies and renewed purpose, while those who cling to hatred will remain trapped in the ruins of the past. Virtue is difficult here because survival feels like a zero-sum game, and the wounds of war are fresh and deep.",

ACT I: BREAKING GROUND

CHARACTER: Yuna

ADVERSITY:
- Internal (Flaw): Believes hope is dangerous, that investing in life will only lead to more loss
- External (Obstacle): Barren, contaminated soil; no seeds, tools, or water; hostile neighbors
- Connection: To create garden, she must overcome her belief that nurturing life is futile

  "emotionalBeat": "elevation",
  "specification": "Yuna returns to garden with her last water. Sun is brutal, body weak, mind tells her she's a fool. She kneels beside the seedlings. For a long moment, she just looks at them. They're so small. So vulnerable. So alive. She makes her choice. Uncaps bottle and begins to pour, slowly, reverently. Whispers to them as she would to a child: 'We both live or we both die. I won't give up on you.' Pours every drop, even as her throat burns. From ruins across street, Jin watches, transfixed. This is the moral elevation moment.",
  "characterFocus": "Yuna (primary), Jin (observer)",

### Phase 5: Scene 4 Content (v1.1 - After Iteration)

```
The sun was a hammer against Yuna's skull. Every step from her tent to the garden felt like wading through fire, her body screaming for the water she'd given away yesterday. Her vision swam at the edges, dark spots dancing like ash from a distant fire.

Stupid. The word chased her across the cracked earth. Stupid to waste water on plants. Stupid to think a garden could matter. Stupid to hope.

[... Scene continues with 1,011 words total...]

She touched one leaf, delicate as paper, trembling in the heat.

"Grow," she whispered. A prayer. A plea. A command to the universe that had taken everything. "Please. Grow."

Her eyes burned. Not from the sun. From something deeper, something she'd thought the war had killed. She blinked and the tears came, hot on her cheeks, salt on her cracked lips.

[... Emotional lingering continues for 3 more paragraphs...]

A sound from across the street. Faint. Sharp. Like someone trying not to breathe.

Yuna turned, scanning the ruins. Nothing moved in the shadows. Just broken buildings and heat shimmer.

She was alone.

## Part IV: Iterative Improvement Process

### Step 1: Generate with Baseline Prompt (v1.0)

Generate stories using initial system prompts, collect metrics.

### Step 2: Identify Issues

From "The Last Garden" baseline test:

**Issue 1**: Virtue scene length below target (683 vs 800-1000 words)
**Issue 2**: Gam-dong response below optimal (40% vs 60% target)
**Issue 3**: POV discipline (observer character intrusion weakened focus)

### Step 3: Update Prompts

**Added to v1.1 Virtue Scene Prompt**:

```markdown
VIRTUE SCENE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Length: Aim for 800-1000 words minimum. This is THE moment—take your time.

Ceremonial Pacing:
- SLOW DOWN during the virtuous action
- Use short sentences or fragments
- Allow silence and stillness
- Let reader witness every detail

Emotional Lingering:
- After virtuous action, give 2-3 paragraphs for emotional resonance
- Show character's internal state AFTER the act
- Physical sensations (trembling, tears, breath)

POV Discipline:
- Do NOT switch to observer's POV in same scene
- Their reaction can be next scene's opening
```

### Step 4: Test & Measure

Generated 5 stories with v1.1 prompts:

| Metric | v1.0 | v1.1 | Improvement |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Word Count | 683 | 1,011 | +48% ✅ |
| Gam-dong Response | 40% | 75% | +35% ✅ |
| POV Discipline | Fair | Excellent | ✅ |

### Step 5: Adopt or Revert

**Decision**: ✅ ADOPT v1.1 as new baseline

Significant improvements across all problem areas with no regressions.

### Step 6: Continue Iteration

Next priority: Consequence scenes (need similar depth and emotional lingering)

---

## Part V: Error Handling & Recovery

### Generation Failures

**Theme Generation Failure**:
- Retry up to 3 times with temperature adjustment
- Fall back to simpler prompt if JSON parsing fails
- Manual intervention after 3 failures

**Content Generation Failure**:
- Scene marked as failed, continue with others
- Retry failed scenes at end
- Manual editing option if AI struggles

**Evaluation Failure**:
- Skip evaluation, keep generated content
- Log for manual review
- Don't block story completion

### Quality Assurance

**Automated Pre-Flight Checks**:
1. Cycle completeness validation
2. Transactional language detection
3. Word count validation
4. Seed tracking integrity
5. Causal chain continuity

**Manual Review Triggers**:
- Scene quality score < 3.0
- Transactional language detected
- Missing cycle components
- Broken causal chain
