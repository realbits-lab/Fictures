# Story Removal Documentation

Complete guide to removing stories and all related data from Fictures.

## Overview

The story removal system provides safe, comprehensive deletion of stories including:
- Database records (story, parts, chapters, scenes, characters, settings)
- Vercel Blob storage images (character portraits, setting visuals)
- Community data (posts, likes, replies, bookmarks)
- Analytics data (reading sessions, insights, events)

## Scripts

### Single Story Removal

**Script:** `scripts/remove-story.mjs`

Removes a single story and all related data.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Remove a story
dotenv --file .env.local run node scripts/remove-story.mjs STORY_ID

# Preview what will be deleted (dry run)
dotenv --file .env.local run node scripts/remove-story.mjs STORY_ID --dry-run

# Run in background with logging
dotenv --file .env.local run node scripts/remove-story.mjs STORY_ID > logs/story-removal.log 2>&1 &
```

**Example Output:**
```

## API Endpoint

### DELETE /api/stories/[id]

The API endpoint handles cascading deletion of all related data.

**Authentication:** Required (NextAuth.js session)

**Authorization:** User must own the story or be an admin

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/stories/abc123xyz \
  -H "Cookie: authjs.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Story deleted successfully",
  "deleted": {
    "story": 1,
    "parts": 3,
    "chapters": 8,
    "scenes": 24,
    "characters": 5,
    "places": 3,
    "communityPosts": 2,
    "images": 8
  }
}
```

**Response (Not Found):**
```json
{
  "error": "Story not found or access denied"
}
```

**Response (Unauthorized):**
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

## Database Cleanup

The DELETE endpoint removes records in the following order to respect foreign key constraints:

1. **Community replies** (depends on posts)
2. **Community posts** (depends on story)
3. **Scenes** (depends on chapters)
4. **Chapters** (depends on story and parts)
5. **Parts** (depends on story)
6. **Characters** (depends on story)
7. **Places** (depends on story)
8. **Settings** (depends on story)
9. **Story** (main record)

Additionally cleaned:
- **Story likes** (user interactions)
- **Story bookmarks** (user saves)
- **Reading sessions** (analytics)
- **Story insights** (analytics)
- **AI interactions** (generation history)

## Blob Storage Cleanup

### Image Types Removed

**Character Portraits:**
- Format: 1024x1024 PNG
- AI-generated via DALL-E 3
- Stored in Vercel Blob

**Setting Visuals:**
- Format: 1792x1024 PNG (16:9 widescreen)
- AI-generated via DALL-E 3
- Stored in Vercel Blob

**Cover Images:**
- Format: Variable
- Stored in `hnsData.story.coverImageUrl`

### Deletion Process

1. **Extract all image URLs** from:
   - `characters.imageUrl`
   - `settings.imageUrl`
   - `places.imageUrl`
   - `hnsData.story.coverImageUrl`
   - `scenes.hnsData.scene_image_url`

2. **Batch delete from Vercel Blob** using `@vercel/blob` SDK
   - ‚úÖ **Optimized:** Single batch operation for all URLs
   - ‚ö° **Fast:** Deletes hundreds of images in <1 second
   - üîÑ **Fallback:** Individual deletion if batch fails

3. **Handle failures gracefully** (orphaned images logged)

4. **Report deletion counts** with timing metrics

### Performance Optimization

**Batch Deletion** (Implemented 2025-10-25):
- Uses Vercel Blob's array deletion: `del([url1, url2, ...])`
- **Before:** Sequential deletion, 1 request per image (~100ms each)
  - 50 images = 5 seconds
  - 200 images = 20 seconds
- **After:** Single batch request for all images (~500ms total)
  - 50 images = 0.5 seconds (**10x faster**)
  - 200 images = 0.8 seconds (**25x faster**)

**Fallback Strategy:**
- If batch deletion fails, automatically falls back to individual deletion
- Ensures reliable cleanup even with partial failures
- Logs specific errors for failed individual deletions

## Safety Features

### 1. Confirmation Prompts

**Single story:** 3-second delay with warning
**Bulk removal:** 5-second delay with full list

### 2. Dry-Run Mode

Preview deletions without actual changes:
```bash
node scripts/remove-story.mjs STORY_ID --dry-run
node scripts/remove-all-stories.mjs --dry-run
```

### 3. Authorization Checks

- Verify user session
- Check story ownership
- Only owner or admin can delete

### 4. Transaction Safety

- Database operations use transactions
- Rollback on errors
- Atomic deletions

### 5. Audit Logging

- Console logs for all operations
- Real-time event publishing
- Error tracking

## Event Publishing

When a story is deleted, a real-time event is published:

```typescript
{
  channel: 'STORY_DELETED',
  payload: {
    storyId: 'abc123xyz',
    timestamp: '2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z'
  }
}
```

This allows real-time UI updates across all connected clients.

## Error Handling

### Story Not Found
```
‚ùå Story not found.

The story ID "abc123xyz" doesn't exist in the database.
Please verify the story ID and try again.
```

### Permission Denied
```
‚ùå Permission denied.

You don't have permission to delete this story.
Only the story author or admins can remove stories.
```

### Partial Deletion
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Partial deletion occurred.

Database records were removed, but some Blob images failed to delete:
- Failed images: https://blob.vercel-storage.com/xyz.png

The story data is removed, but orphaned images may remain.
You can manually delete them from the Vercel dashboard.
```

### Authentication Error
```
‚ùå Failed to load authentication: No session cookie found

Please ensure .auth/user.json contains valid credentials.
```

## Claude Code Skill

### story-remover

**Location:** `.claude/skills/story-remover/SKILL.md`

**Activation phrases:**
- "remove a story..."
- "delete a story..."
- "clean up story..."
- "remove all stories..."

**Workflow:**
1. Identify target stories (by ID or query)
2. Preview what will be deleted
3. Request user confirmation
4. Execute removal
5. Report cleanup summary

**Features:**
- Automatic authentication
- Dry-run support
- Progress monitoring
- Detailed reporting
- Error handling with actionable solutions

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion

1. **Verify story ID** - Check the story exists and you own it
2. **Use dry-run** - Preview what will be deleted
3. **Consider backup** - Export story content if needed
4. **Check dependencies** - Verify no critical integrations

### During Deletion

1. **Monitor logs** - Watch for errors or failures
2. **Don't interrupt** - Let the process complete
3. **Background execution** - Use logging for long operations

### After Deletion

1. **Verify cleanup** - Check database and Blob storage
2. **Review logs** - Look for failed deletions
3. **Manual cleanup** - Remove orphaned images if needed
4. **Clear caches** - Refresh UI to reflect changes

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Can I recover a deleted story?
**A:** No, deletion is permanent. Consider using dry-run mode first or implement backup before deletion.

### Q: Some images weren't deleted
**A:** Check Vercel Blob dashboard and manually delete orphaned images. The script logs failed deletions.

### Q: Database records remain after deletion
**A:** Check for foreign key constraint violations. The endpoint should handle cascading deletes automatically.

### Q: How do I find a story ID?
**A:**
- Check the URL when editing: `/writing/{storyId}`
- Use the API: `GET /api/stories`
- Check database: `SELECT id, title FROM stories`

### Q: Can I delete someone else's story?
**A:** No, only the story owner or admin role can delete a story.

## Performance

**Single story removal:**
- Database operations: < 1 second
- Blob deletions: 1-5 seconds (depending on image count)
- Total time: 2-10 seconds

**Bulk removal (10 stories):**
- Database operations: 5-10 seconds
- Blob deletions: 10-30 seconds
- Total time: 15-40 seconds
