# Bug Fix: Genre Join Error in Story Generation Summary

## Issue

The story generation script (`scripts/generate-complete-story.mjs`) was crashing in the final summary report with this error:

```
❌ ERROR: story.genre?.join is not a function
💥 Fatal error: story.genre?.join is not a function
```

## Root Cause

The code assumed `story.genre` was an array and tried to call `.join(', ')` on it:

```javascript
console.log(`   Genre: ${story.genre?.join(', ') || 'N/A'}`);
```

However, in the database schema (`src/lib/db/schema.ts`), the `genre` field is defined as:

```typescript
genre: varchar('genre', { length: 100 }),
```

This is a **string** field, not an array. When the story data is fetched from the database, `genre` is a string (e.g., `"Detective"`), which doesn't have a `.join()` method.

## Solution

Updated both occurrences of genre display (lines 184 and 317) to handle both string and array formats:

```javascript
// Before (broken)
console.log(`   Genre: ${story.genre?.join(', ') || 'N/A'}`);

// After (fixed)
console.log(`   Genre: ${Array.isArray(story.genre) ? story.genre.join(', ') : (story.genre || 'N/A')}`);
```

### Logic:
1. **If array**: Join elements with `', '` → `"Mystery, Thriller"`
2. **If string**: Display as-is → `"Detective"`
3. **If null/undefined/empty**: Display `"N/A"`

## Test Results

All test cases pass:

```
Test 1: ✅ PASS - String genre: "Detective" → "Detective"
Test 2: ✅ PASS - Array genre: ["Mystery", "Thriller"] → "Mystery, Thriller"
Test 3: ✅ PASS - Null genre: null → "N/A"
Test 4: ✅ PASS - Undefined genre: undefined → "N/A"
Test 5: ✅ PASS - Empty string: "" → "N/A"
```

## Files Modified

- `scripts/generate-complete-story.mjs`:
  - Line 184: Story structure display during generation
  - Line 317: Final summary report after generation

## Impact

✅ Story generation scripts now complete successfully  
✅ Final summary displays correctly  
✅ Both string and array genre formats supported  
✅ Graceful handling of missing/null values

This fix ensures the `--publish` flag works correctly, as publishing previously failed due to the summary error occurring before the publish step could execute.
