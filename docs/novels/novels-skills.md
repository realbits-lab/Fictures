## Part I: Architecture & Design

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

The new skills implement **document-based generation** with three core principles:

#### Principle 1: Self-Contained Documents
- All story data saved as markdown/JSON
- No external dependencies (database, API, auth)
- Human-readable formats for easy editing
- Git-friendly for version control

#### Principle 2: System Prompt Transparency
- All generation prompts saved alongside outputs
- Enables reproducibility and debugging
- Supports iterative prompt improvement
- Documents AI decision-making process

#### Principle 3: Modular Workflow
- Independent skills for generation, evaluation, images
- Each skill can run standalone
- Clear input/output contracts
- Enables selective regeneration

- **Git-friendly**: Text files track changes cleanly
- **Self-documenting**: Prompts included for transparency
- **Portable**: Copy directory anywhere, no dependencies
- **Versioned**: Multiple generations can coexist

### 1.3 Adversity-Triumph Engine Integration

All three skills implement the **Cyclic Adversity-Triumph Engine** methodology from `docs/novels/novels-specification.md`:

#### The 4-Phase Cycle

```
1. ADVERSITY
   ├─ Internal flaw (fear/belief/wound)
   └─ External obstacle (forces confrontation)

2. VIRTUOUS ACTION
   ├─ Intrinsically motivated (not transactional)
   └─ Demonstrates moral virtue (courage/compassion/integrity/etc.)

3. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE (Earned Luck)
   ├─ Surprising resolution/reward
   ├─ Causally linked to past actions
   └─ Karmic/poetic justice

4. NEW ADVERSITY
   ├─ Resolution creates next problem
   └─ Stakes escalate
```

#### Nested Cycles Architecture

- **Story Level**: Moral framework and thematic premise
- **Part Level (Acts)**: MACRO adversity-triumph arcs (2-4 chapters each)
- **Chapter Level**: MICRO cycles that progressively build macro arcs
- **Scene Level**: 5 scene types (setup, confrontation, virtue, consequence, transition)

## Part III: Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Claude Code Skills Architecture

Based on official Claude Code documentation (`docs.claude.com/claude-code/skills`):

#### YAML Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of functionality and usage triggers (max 1024 chars)
---
```

**Requirements:**
- `name`: Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars)
- `description`: Explains both functionality and activation triggers

#### Skill Activation

- **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously activates when user request matches
- **NOT user-invoked**: Unlike slash commands, skills activate automatically
- **Context-aware**: Activation based on user's natural language request

#### File Organization

```
.claude/skills/
├── novel-generator/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── novel-evaluator/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── image-generator/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Git-tracked (committed to repository)
- Team-shared (available to all team members)
- Self-documenting (markdown format)
- Extensible (can add reference.md, templates/, scripts/)

### 3.2 Integration with Existing Documentation

The skills reference comprehensive documentation in `docs/novels/`:

#### Primary References

1. **novels-specification.md** (Part I: Core Concepts)
   - Adversity-triumph cycle definition
   - Emotional triggers (empathy, catharsis, moral elevation, Gam-dong)
   - Cultural context (Jeong, Han, Gam-dong)
   - Hierarchical story structure

2. **novels-generation.md** (Part II: System Prompts)
   - 8 complete system prompts with examples
   - Implementation notes (models, temperatures, post-processing)
   - Expected performance metrics
   - Iterative improvement process

3. **novels-testing.md**
   - Quality metrics and validation
   - Testing strategies
   - Expected evaluation results

4. **novels-optimization.md**
   - Image optimization strategy (4-variant system)
   - Mobile-first approach rationale
   - Browser support data

#### Documentation Integrity

- **No duplication**: Skills reference docs, don't duplicate
- **Single source of truth**: docs/novels/ is authoritative
- **Versioning**: Skills and docs stay synchronized
- **Extensibility**: New skills can use same references

### 3.3 Infrastructure Changes

#### Created Directories

```bash
outputs/              # New: Novel generation output directory
  └── .gitkeep        # (to be created by first generation)

.claude/skills/       # Updated: New skills structure
  ├── novel-generator/
  ├── novel-evaluator/
  └── image-generator/
```

#### Updated .gitignore

```gitignore
# Output directory
@output/
outputs/              # Added: Ignore all generated novels
```

**Rationale:**
- Generated novels can be very large (10-100MB with images)
- User-specific content (not shared in repository)
- Can be regenerated from prompts if needed
- Optional: User can force-add specific novels for sharing

#### Removed Legacy Skills

```bash
# Deleted:
.claude/skills/story-generator/
.claude/skills/story-remover/
```

**Rationale:**
- API/database-dependent (incompatible with document-based approach)
- Duplicated functionality (replaced by novel-generator)
- Confusing user experience (two similar skills)

```

#### Storage Estimates

- **Small novel** (5-10 chapters, no images): ~500KB - 1MB
- **Medium novel** (10-20 chapters, with images): ~20-50MB
- **Large novel** (20+ chapters, full images): ~50-150MB

**Recommendation**: Keep last 5-10 generations, archive older novels

## Part VIII: Troubleshooting & FAQs

### 8.1 Common Issues

#### Issue: Generation Takes Too Long

**Symptoms**: Novel generation exceeds expected time (60+ minutes for small novel)

**Causes:**
- Many scenes requiring multiple improvement iterations
- Network latency to AI model API
- Complex prompts with extensive context

**Solutions:**
- Reduce evaluation strictness (2.5 instead of 3.0)
- Generate structure first, scenes later (pause between phases)
- Check network connection quality

#### Issue: Low Scene Quality Scores

**Symptoms**: Many scenes score below 3.0 even after improvements

**Causes:**
- Vague story prompt (insufficient context)
- Genre/tone mismatch with adversity-triumph framework
- System prompts need refinement

**Solutions:**
- Provide more detailed story prompt
- Check if genre is suitable (narrative fiction works best)
- Review and update system prompts in docs/novels/

#### Issue: Images Don't Match Story Tone

**Symptoms**: Generated images have wrong style or mood

**Causes:**
- Visual style not specified or incorrect
- Character/setting descriptions too vague
- Prompt construction missing key details

**Solutions:**
- Explicitly set visualStyle in novel metadata
- Add more distinctive features to character profiles
- Include color palettes and visual references in settings

### 8.2 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I edit generated novels?**
A: Yes! Novels are markdown files. Edit with any text editor, then re-run novel-evaluator to assess changes.

**Q: How do I share a generated novel?**
A: Copy the entire `outputs/[story]/` directory. It's fully self-contained.

**Q: Can I regenerate just one chapter?**
A: Currently, regeneration is all-or-nothing. Selective regeneration is planned for future release.

**Q: Do I need API keys?**
A: Yes, you need Gemini API key for AI generation. Set as environment variable or provide when prompted.

**Q: Can I use other AI models?**
A: System prompts are model-agnostic. You can adapt to GPT-4, Claude, or other models by adjusting API calls.

**Q: What if evaluation scores are harsh?**
A: Score 3.0 = professional standard. Below 3.0 indicates real issues. Manual editing after generation is expected.

**Q: Can I generate non-fiction?**
A: No, adversity-triumph framework is designed for narrative fiction with character arcs.

**Q: How do I version control novels?**
A: Commit `outputs/[story]/` to git. Markdown files diff cleanly for version tracking.

### 8.3 Known Limitations

1. **No real-time progress**: Generation happens in terminal, no UI updates
2. **All-or-nothing regeneration**: Can't regenerate single scenes yet
3. **Manual image upload**: No built-in image upload to Vercel Blob
4. **No web UI**: Skills are terminal-only (by design)
5. **Single-user**: No collaboration features (yet)
