# Novels Generation Specification: Adversity-Triumph Engine

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the novels generation system using a **Cyclic Adversity-Triumph Engine** as the core narrative framework. This architecture is grounded in psychological principles of emotional resonance, focusing on empathy, catharsis, moral elevation, and the Korean concept of Gam-dong (Í∞êÎèô - profound emotional moving).

**Core Principle**: Stories generate deep emotional resonance through continuous cycles of adversity and triumph, powered by causally-linked serendipity (earned luck), unintended karmic rewards, and virtuous character actions.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Validated and Ready for Implementation**

## Part I: Core Concepts

### 1.1 The Adversity-Triumph Cycle

Each narrative cycle consists of four phases:

1. **Adversity Establishment**
   - **Internal Conflict**: Character's flaw, wound, false belief, or fear
   - **External Conflict**: Obstacle, antagonist, or environmental challenge
   - **Key**: External conflict must force confrontation with internal conflict

2. **Virtuous Action**
   - Character performs morally beautiful act
   - **Intrinsically motivated** (not transactional, not for expected reward)
   - Demonstrates courage, compassion, integrity, sacrifice, or loyalty
   - Triggers **moral elevation** in audience

3. **Unintended Consequence (Earned Luck)**
   - Surprising resolution or reward emerges
   - **Causally linked** to character's prior actions/virtue
   - Feels serendipitous but is actually inevitable in retrospect
   - NOT deus ex machina - must be earned through character traits
   - Delivers **karmic payoff** that affirms moral order

4. **New Adversity Creation**
   - Resolution directly/indirectly creates next challenge
   - Stakes escalate in complexity or intensity
   - Maintains narrative momentum
   - Propels character deeper into transformation

### 1.2 Emotional Triggers

Each cycle is engineered to elicit specific emotions:

| Emotion | Definition | Narrative Trigger |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Empathy** | Understanding and sharing character's feelings | Deep POV, relatable flaws, vulnerability |
| **Catharsis** | Purgation of intense emotions (pity, fear, disgust, rage) | Tragic confrontation, moral cleansing |
| **Moral Elevation** | Uplifting warmth from witnessing virtue | Non-transactional acts of goodness |
| **Gam-dong** (Í∞êÎèô) | Profound, soul-stirring emotional response | Unintended karmic rewards, affirmation of Jeong (Ï†ï - deep connection) |

### 1.3 Cultural Context

**Korean Emotional Concepts:**
- **Jeong (Ï†ï)**: Deep affection, loyalty, binding connection between people
- **Han (Ìïú)**: Unresolved grief, resentment, historical/personal wound
- **Gam-dong (Í∞êÎèô)**: Being profoundly moved to tears or joy

**Narrative Goal**: Create stories that heal Han through Jeong, culminating in Gam-dong

### 1.4 Quick Reference: Cycle Structure

**The 4-Phase Adversity-Triumph Cycle** (narrative structure):

```
1. ADVERSITY
   - Internal flaw (fear/belief/wound) + External obstacle
   - External conflict forces confrontation with internal conflict

2. VIRTUOUS ACTION
   - Character performs intrinsically motivated good deed
   - NOT transactional ("to get X")
   - Demonstrates courage/compassion/integrity/sacrifice/loyalty/wisdom

3. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE (Earned Luck)
   - Surprising resolution/reward emerges
   - Causally linked to past actions (not random)
   - Feels like karmic justice or poetic justice

4. NEW ADVERSITY
   - Resolution creates next problem
   - Stakes escalate
   - Cycle perpetuates
```

**Important Distinction:**
- **4 Cycle Phases** = The narrative structure (what happens in the story)
- **5 Scene Types** = How we divide the cycle into prose scenes (implementation)

See section 2.4 for how the 4-phase cycle maps to 5 scene types in practice.

### 1.5 Critical Success Factors

**Core Principles:**
1. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Virtuous actions MUST be genuine, not strategic
2. **Causal Linking**: Every event connects to previous actions (no deus ex machina)
3. **Seed Tracking**: Small actions pay off later as "earned luck"
4. **Cyclical Engine**: Every resolution creates next adversity
5. **Emotional Authenticity**: Show emotions through body/action, not tell

## Part II: Hierarchical Story Structure

### 2.1 Story Level (Foundation)

**Purpose**: Establish the world's moral framework and general thematic premise

**Key Field**:
- `summary` (text): General thematic premise, genre, tone, moral landscape
- NOT detailed adversity-triumph - just the world and its rules

**Content Format**:
```
Summary: "In a world where [setting/context], [moral principle] is tested when [inciting situation]"

Example: "In a fractured post-war society where trust has been shattered, the power of human connection is tested when strangers are forced to rely on each other to survive"
```

**Metadata to Track:**
- **Genre**: mystery, romance, thriller, fantasy, etc.
- **Tone**: hopeful, dark, bittersweet, satirical
- **Moral Framework**: What virtues are valued? What vices are punished?
- **Characters** (2-4 main): name, core trait, internal flaw, external goal

### 2.2 Part Level (Act Structure)

**Purpose**: Define MACRO adversity-triumph arc for EACH main character within this act

**Key Concept: Nested Cycles**
- **Macro Arc** (Part-level): Complete character transformation over 2-4 chapters
- **Micro Cycles** (Chapter-level): Progressive steps building toward macro payoff

**Key Field**:
- `summary` (text): MACRO adversity-triumph arcs per character with progression planning

**Content Structure**:
```
ACT [I/II/III]: [Act Name]

CHARACTER: [Name]

MACRO ARC (Overall transformation for this act):
- Macro Adversity: [Major challenge/flaw confrontation]
- Macro Virtue: [Defining moral choice - THE moment for this act]
- Macro Consequence: [Major earned payoff/karmic result]
- Macro New Adversity: [How this creates next act's challenge]

PROGRESSION PLANNING:
- Estimated Chapters: [2-4 typically]
- Arc Position: [primary/secondary - primary gets more chapters]
- Progression Strategy: [How arc unfolds gradually]
  * Chapter N (Beginning): Setup macro adversity, first small choice
  * Chapter N+1 (Middle): Escalate crisis, bigger choices required
  * Chapter N+2 (Climax): MACRO VIRTUE demonstrated, major consequence
  * [Optional] Chapter N+3 (Resolution): Aftermath, transition

CHARACTER: [Name]
- Macro Arc: ...
- Progression: ...
- [etc.]

CHARACTER INTERACTIONS:
- How do their macro arcs intersect?
- Which chapters feature which characters? (Rotation strategy)
- What relationships (Jeong) form or deepen?
- What shared Han (wounds) are revealed?
- How do parallel arcs build toward convergence?
```

**Three-Act Structure Mapping**:
- **Act I (Setup)**: Introduce character flaws, inciting incident creates first adversity
  - Each character's macro arc unfolds over 2-3 chapters
- **Act II (Confrontation)**: Escalating macro arcs, midpoint reversal, character hits lowest point
  - Primary characters get 3-4 chapters, secondary get 2 chapters
  - Arcs interleave for variety and parallel development
- **Act III (Resolution)**: Final macro arcs resolve both internal and external conflicts
  - All character arcs converge toward story climax

### 2.3 Chapter Level (Micro Cycle)

**Purpose**: ONE complete adversity-triumph cycle (micro-cycle) that progressively builds the character's macro arc

**Key Concept: Micro Cycles within Macro Arcs**
- Each chapter is a self-contained cycle (complete on its own)
- Collectively, 2-4 micro-cycles build one macro arc
- Each micro-cycle advances the character toward their defining moment

**Key Fields**:
- `summary` (text): One micro-cycle adversity-triumph
- `characterId` (text): References Character.id (the character whose macro arc this chapter advances)
- `arcPosition` (enum): 'beginning' | 'middle' | 'climax' | 'resolution' (climax = MACRO moment)
- `contributesToMacroArc` (text): How does this advance the macro transformation?

**Content Structure**:
```
CHAPTER [N]: [Title]

MACRO ARC CONTEXT:
- Character: [Name]
- Macro Arc: [Brief macro adversity ‚Üí macro virtue summary]
- Position in Arc: [beginning/middle/climax/resolution] (climax = MACRO moment)

MICRO-CYCLE (This Chapter):
FOCUS: [Character name(s)]
CONNECTED TO: [Previous chapter resolution that created this adversity]

ADVERSITY (Micro):
- Internal: [Specific fear/flaw being confronted]
- External: [Specific obstacle in this chapter]
- How it Advances Macro: [Connection to overall arc]

VIRTUOUS ACTION (Micro or MACRO):
- What: [Specific moral choice/act of goodness]
- Why: [Character's intrinsic motivation - NOT transactional]
- Is This MACRO Virtue?: [Yes/No]
- Seeds Planted: [What setup for future payoff?]

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE (Micro or MACRO):
- What: [Surprising resolution/reward]
- Why Earned: [How is this causally linked to past actions?]
- Seeds Resolved: [What past setup pays off here?]
- Magnitude: [Minor payoff OR Major macro consequence]

NEW ADVERSITY (Micro or MACRO):
- What: [Next problem created by this resolution]
- Stakes: [How are they higher than before?]
- Leads To: [Next chapter OR next act if macro moment]

PROGRESSION CONTRIBUTION:
[1-2 sentences explaining how this micro-cycle moves character closer to their macro virtue moment]
```

**Key Principles**:
- Each chapter MUST be a complete micro-cycle (works standalone)
- Each chapter MUST advance its macro arc progressively
- Focus on 1-2 characters max to maintain emotional depth
- Rotate between characters for variety (not all chapters for one character)
- Build tension gradually: beginning ‚Üí middle ‚Üí CLIMAX (macro moment)
- Climax chapter contains MACRO virtue and MACRO consequence

### 2.4 Scene Level (Cycle Phases)

**Purpose**: Divide chapter's adversity-triumph cycle into 3-7 narrative beats

**Key Fields**:
- `summary` (text): Scene specification - what happens, emotional beat, purpose, sensory anchors
- `content` (text): Full prose narrative generated from the summary

**Mapping 4-Phase Cycle to 5 Scene Types:**

The 4-phase narrative cycle (Adversity ‚Üí Virtue ‚Üí Consequence ‚Üí New Adversity) is implemented as 5 scene types to provide better pacing and emotional flow:

**Scene Types by Cycle Phase**:

1. **Setup Scenes** (1-2 scenes)
   - Establish current emotional state
   - Introduce external threat/obstacle
   - Show internal resistance/fear

2. **Confrontation Scenes** (1-3 scenes)
   - Character faces challenge
   - Internal conflict externalized through action/dialogue
   - Moral choice emerges

3. **Virtue Scenes** (1 scene)
   - Character performs intrinsically motivated good act
   - Moment of moral elevation for audience
   - No expectation of reward shown

4. **Consequence Scenes** (1-2 scenes)
   - Unintended reward/complication manifests
   - Reversal that feels earned but surprising
   - Karmic justice demonstrated

5. **Transition Scenes** (1 scene)
   - New adversity becomes apparent
   - Hook for next chapter
   - Character's emotional state shifts

**Two-Step Generation Process**:
1. Generate `summary` for all scenes in chapter (planning)
2. Generate `content` for each scene using its summary (execution)

## Part III: Data Model Specification

### 3.1 Character Schema (Zero-Base Design)

**Philosophy**: Characters are **moral agents** whose internal flaws create adversity, whose core virtues drive triumph, and whose transformation generates emotional resonance (Gam-dong).

```typescript
// Character table
interface Character {
  // === IDENTITY ===
  id: string;
  storyId: string;
  name: string;
  isMain: boolean; // Main characters (2-4) get MACRO arcs
  summary: string; // 1-2 sentence essence: "[CoreTrait] [role] [internalFlaw], seeking [externalGoal]"

  // === ADVERSITY-TRIUMPH CORE (The Engine) ===
  coreTrait: string; // THE defining moral virtue: "courage" | "compassion" | "integrity" | "loyalty" | "wisdom" | "sacrifice"
  internalFlaw: string; // MUST include cause: "[fears/believes/wounded by] X because Y"
  externalGoal: string; // What they THINK will solve their problem (healing flaw actually will)

  // === CHARACTER DEPTH (For Realistic Portrayal) ===
  personality: {
    traits: string[];        // Behavioral traits: "impulsive", "optimistic", "stubborn"
    values: string[];        // What they care about: "family", "honor", "freedom"
  };
  backstory: string; // Focused history providing motivation context (2-4 paragraphs)

  // === RELATIONSHIPS (Jeong System) ===
  relationships: {
    [characterId: string]: {
      type: 'ally' | 'rival' | 'family' | 'romantic' | 'mentor' | 'adversary';
      jeongLevel: number;      // 0-10: depth of connection (Ï†ï - affective bonds)
      sharedHistory: string;   // What binds them
      currentDynamic: string;  // Current relationship state
    };
  };

  // === PROSE GENERATION ===
  physicalDescription: {
    age: string;               // "mid-30s", "elderly", "young adult"
    appearance: string;        // Overall look
    distinctiveFeatures: string; // Memorable details for "show don't tell"
    style: string;            // How they dress/present themselves
  };
  voiceStyle: {
    tone: string;             // "warm", "sarcastic", "formal", "gentle"
    vocabulary: string;       // "simple", "educated", "technical", "poetic"
    quirks: string[];        // Verbal tics, repeated phrases
    emotionalRange: string;  // "reserved", "expressive", "volatile"
  };

  // === VISUAL GENERATION ===
  imageUrl?: string;  // Original portrait (1024√ó1024 from DALL-E 3)
  imageVariants?: {
    imageId: string;
    originalUrl: string;
    variants: Array<{
      format: 'avif' | 'webp' | 'jpeg';
      width: number;
      height: number;
      url: string;
      size: number;
    }>;
    generatedAt: string;
  };
  visualStyle?: string; // "realistic" | "anime" | "painterly" | "cinematic"

  // === METADATA ===
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Key Field Rationales

**coreTrait** (Critical):
- THE defining moral virtue that drives virtue scenes
- Single trait for focused moral elevation moments
- Valid values: courage, compassion, integrity, loyalty, wisdom, sacrifice
- Used in Part generation for MACRO virtue definition

**internalFlaw** (Critical):
- Source of ADVERSITY in cycles
- **MUST include cause** for specificity and empathy
- Format: "[fears/believes/wounded by] X because Y"
- Examples:
  - ‚úÖ "fears abandonment because lost family in war and never felt secure since"
  - ‚úÖ "believes strength means never showing emotion because father punished vulnerability"
  - ‚ùå "has trust issues" (too vague)

**externalGoal**:
- What character THINKS will solve their problem
- Creates dramatic irony (healing flaw is actual solution)
- External obstacle forces facing internal flaw

**personality vs coreTrait**:
- `coreTrait` = **MORAL** virtue (drives virtue scenes)
- `personality.traits` = **BEHAVIORAL** characteristics (drives everyday scenes)
- Both needed for dimensional, realistic characters

**relationships (Jeong System)**:
- Tracks Ï†ï (deep affective bonds) between characters
- `jeongLevel` (0-10) determines emotional stakes
- High jeongLevel (7-10) makes virtuous actions more meaningful
- Enables relationship arcs parallel to character arcs

**voiceStyle**:
- Ensures distinct, authentic dialogue per character
- Prevents generic "everyone sounds the same" problem
- AI uses this to generate character-specific speech patterns

### 3.2 Setting Schema (Zero-Base Design)

**Philosophy**: Settings are **emotional environments** that create external adversity, amplify cycle phases through atmosphere, and serve as symbolic mirrors for character transformation.

```typescript
// Setting table
interface Setting {
  // === IDENTITY ===
  id: string;
  storyId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string; // Comprehensive paragraph (3-5 sentences)

  // === ADVERSITY-TRIUMPH CORE (The Engine) ===
  adversityElements: {
    physicalObstacles: string[];    // Environmental challenges: "harsh desert heat", "crumbling infrastructure"
    scarcityFactors: string[];      // Limited resources that force choices: "water shortage", "food scarcity"
    dangerSources: string[];        // Threats from environment: "unstable buildings", "hostile wildlife"
    socialDynamics: string[];       // Community factors: "distrust between neighbors", "gang territories"
  };
  symbolicMeaning: string;          // How setting reflects story's moral framework (1-2 sentences)
  cycleAmplification: {
    setup: string;                  // How setting establishes adversity: "oppressive heat weighs on characters"
    confrontation: string;          // How setting intensifies conflict: "confined space forces interaction"
    virtue: string;                 // How setting contrasts/witnesses moral beauty: "barren land vs. act of nurture"
    consequence: string;            // How setting transforms or reveals: "garden blooms, proving hope possible"
    transition: string;             // How setting hints at new problems: "storm clouds gathering"
  };

  // === EMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE ===
  mood: string;                     // Primary emotional quality: "oppressive and surreal", "hopeful but fragile"
  emotionalResonance: string;       // What emotion this amplifies: "isolation", "hope", "fear", "connection"

  // === SENSORY IMMERSION (For Prose Generation) ===
  sensory: {
    sight: string[];                // Visual details (5-10 items)
    sound: string[];                // Auditory elements (3-7 items)
    smell: string[];                // Olfactory details (2-5 items)
    touch: string[];                // Tactile sensations (2-5 items)
    taste: string[];                // Flavor elements (0-2 items, optional)
  };
  architecturalStyle?: string;      // Structural design language (if applicable)

  // === VISUAL GENERATION ===
  imageUrl?: string;  // Original environment image (1792√ó1024, 16:9 from DALL-E 3)
  imageVariants?: {
    imageId: string;
    originalUrl: string;
    variants: Array<{
      format: 'avif' | 'webp' | 'jpeg';
      width: number;
      height: number;
      url: string;
      size: number;
    }>;
    generatedAt: string;
  };
  visualStyle: string;              // "realistic" | "anime" | "painterly" | "cinematic"
  visualReferences: string[];       // Style inspirations: ["Blade Runner 2049", "Studio Ghibli countryside"]
  colorPalette: string[];           // Dominant colors: ["warm golds", "dusty browns", "deep greens"]

  // === METADATA ===
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Key Field Rationales

**adversityElements** (Critical):
- THE source of external conflict in adversity-triumph cycles
- Creates obstacles that force characters to confront internal flaws
- Four categories cover all environmental adversity types:
  - Physical: Tangible environmental challenges
  - Scarcity: Resource limitations forcing moral choices
  - Danger: Threats requiring courage/sacrifice
  - Social: Community dynamics creating interpersonal conflict

**symbolicMeaning**:
- Connects setting to story's moral framework
- Makes environment meaningful beyond just backdrop
- Example: "Destroyed city represents broken trust and loss of community‚Äîgarden becomes symbol of healing and renewal"

**cycleAmplification**:
- Specifies HOW setting amplifies each cycle phase
- Guides scene content generation to use setting appropriately
- Ensures setting actively participates in emotional architecture
- Different settings can amplify same phase differently (desert heat vs. cold rain both create adversity)

**sensory arrays**:
- Provide concrete details for "show don't tell" prose
- Ground abstract emotions in physical experiences
- Enable deep sensory immersion in scenes
- Must be SPECIFIC: "wind rattling dry leaves" not "nature sounds"

**cycleAmplification vs mood**:
- `mood` = Overall atmospheric quality (static)
- `cycleAmplification` = How atmosphere shifts with narrative phases (dynamic)
- Both needed for rich, emotionally responsive environments

### 3.3 Story Schema

```typescript
// Story table
interface Story {
  id: string;
  userId: string;

  // NEW: Consistent with part/chapter naming
  summary: string; // General thematic premise and moral framework

  moralFramework: string; // "What virtues are valued in this world?"

  // Main characters reference (stored in characters table)
  // 2-4 main characters with isMain=true

  // Settings reference (stored in settings table)
  // 2-6 primary settings where story unfolds

  // Deprecated (keep for migration)
  premise?: string;
  dramaticQuestion?: string;
  theme?: string; // Deprecated - migrated to summary

  createdAt: Date;

  // Tracking structure - ENHANCED for nested cycles
  characterArcs: {
    characterId: string; // References Character.id

    // MACRO ARC (Part-level transformation)
    // Derived from Character.internalFlaw, Character.coreTrait, Character.externalGoal
    macroAdversity: {
      internal: string;  // From Character.internalFlaw
      external: string;  // External obstacle that forces facing internal flaw
    };
    macroVirtue: string;         // From Character.coreTrait - THE defining moral choice
    macroConsequence: string;    // Earned payoff for virtue
    macroNewAdversity: string;   // How resolution creates next act's challenge

    // NEW: Progression planning
    estimatedChapters: number;     // 2-4 typical
    arcPosition: 'primary' | 'secondary';  // Primary arcs get more chapters
    progressionStrategy: string;    // How does this unfold gradually?
    // Example: "Gradual escalation across 3 chapters: setup ‚Üí crisis ‚Üí resolution"
  }[];

  // Deprecated
  description?: string;
  thematicFocus?: string;

  order: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 3.5 Chapter Schema

```typescript
// Chapter table
interface Chapter {
  id: string;
  partId: string;
  storyId: string;

  title: string;

  // NEW: Single adversity-triumph cycle
  summary: string;

  // NEW: Nested cycle tracking (links micro-cycle to macro arc)
  characterId: string; // References Character.id (the character whose macro arc this chapter advances)
  arcPosition: 'beginning' | 'middle' | 'climax' | 'resolution'; // 'climax' = MACRO moment

  // Causal linking for earned luck
  seedsPlanted: {
    id: string;
    description: string;
    expectedPayoff: string;
  }[];

  seedsResolved: {
    sourceChapterId: string;
    sourceSceneId: string;
    seedId: string;
    payoffDescription: string;
  }[];

  // Connection to narrative flow

  createsNextAdversity: string; // How this resolution creates next problem

  // Deprecated
  description?: string;
  dramaticQuestion?: string;

  order: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 3.6 Scene Schema

```typescript
// Scene table
interface Scene {
  id: string;
  chapterId: string;
  storyId: string;

  title: string;

  // NEW: Scene specification (planning layer)
  summary: string; // Scene specification: what happens, emotional beat, purpose, sensory anchors

  // Cycle phase tracking
  cyclePhase: 'setup' | 'confrontation' | 'virtue' | 'consequence' | 'transition';
  emotionalBeat: 'fear' | 'hope' | 'tension' | 'relief' | 'elevation' | 'catharsis' | 'despair' | 'joy';

  // Generated prose (execution layer)
  content: string; // Full prose narrative generated from summary

  // Existing fields
  imageUrl?: string;
  imageVariants?: ImageVariants;

  order: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 3.7 Migration Strategy

**Phase 1**: Add new fields alongside existing
- Story: Add `summary`, `genre`, `tone`, `moralFramework`
- Character: Add `isMain`, `summary`, `coreTrait`, `internalFlaw`, `externalGoal`, `relationships`, `voiceStyle`
- Setting: Add `adversityElements`, `symbolicMeaning`, `cycleAmplification`, `emotionalResonance`
- Part: Add `summary`, `characterArcs`
- Chapter: Add `summary`, cycle tracking fields
- Scene: Add `summary`, `cyclePhase`, `emotionalBeat`

**Phase 2**: Migrate existing data
- Convert old `premise` + `dramaticQuestion` + `theme` ‚Üí new `summary`
- Convert old part `description` ‚Üí new `summary`
- Convert old chapter `description` ‚Üí new `summary`
- Scene `summary` starts empty (new field, no migration needed)

**Phase 3**: Deprecate old fields
- Mark `premise`, `dramaticQuestion`, `theme` as optional in schema
- Remove from UI
- Remove from new story generation

**Naming Consistency**:
All hierarchical levels now use `summary` for their planning/specification layer:
- `Story.summary`: General thematic premise and moral framework
- `Part.summary`: Adversity-triumph cycles for this act
- `Chapter.summary`: Single adversity-triumph cycle
- `Scene.summary`: Scene specification (what happens, purpose, sensory anchors)
- `Scene.content`: Full prose narrative (execution layer)

## Part V: Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Schema (Week 1-2)

**Tasks**:

## Part VI: Comparison to Current HNS System

### Current HNS (Hero's Noble Struggle)
- Focus: Story metadata (premise, dramatic question, theme)
- Structure: Hierarchical but not cycle-based
- Emotional design: Implicit, not engineered
- Quality control: Scene evaluation after generation

### New Adversity-Triumph System
- Focus: Emotional engineering at every level
- Structure: Hierarchical AND cycle-based (fractal design)
- Emotional design: Explicit targeting of empathy/elevation/catharsis/Gam-dong
- Quality control: Cycle validation + scene evaluation + iterative improvement

### Migration Strategy
- **Keep**: Existing scene evaluation, image generation, publishing flow
- **Replace**: Theme/part/chapter generation with new APIs
- **Enhance**: Scene generation with cycle-aware prompts
- **Add**: Seed tracking, causal linking validation, emotional metrics

## Part VII: References

This architecture is grounded in:

1. **"The Architecture of Affect" Research Document**
   - Adversity-Triumph Engine mechanics
   - Causally-linked serendipity principles
   - Emotional trigger taxonomy
   - Gam-dong, Jeong, Han concepts

2. **Narrative Theory**
   - Three-Act Structure (Aristotle, Syd Field)
   - The Hero's Journey (Joseph Campbell)
   - Character Arc Theory (internal + external conflict)

3. **Psychology**
   - Moral elevation (Haidt)
   - Catharsis (Aristotelian interpretation)
   - Narrative transportation (Green & Brock)
   - Empathy through fiction (Mar & Oatley)

4. **Cultural Studies**
   - Korean drama narrative techniques
   - Affective interludes
   - Jeong-based storytelling

## Conclusion

This specification transforms story generation from plot-driven to **emotion-driven**, using the Cyclic Adversity-Triumph Engine as the core mechanism for creating profound emotional resonance.

**Key Innovation**: Every level of the narrative hierarchy (story ‚Üí part ‚Üí chapter ‚Üí scene) is structured around adversity-triumph cycles, with each cycle designed to trigger specific emotions (empathy ‚Üí moral elevation ‚Üí catharsis ‚Üí Gam-dong).

**Implementation Priority**: Focus on system prompt engineering first‚Äîthis is where 80% of the quality comes from. The data model and APIs are just scaffolding for the prompts to work effectively.

**Expected Outcome**: Stories that don't just entertain, but move readers deeply through the careful architecture of moral beauty, earned triumph, and the affirmation of human virtue.
