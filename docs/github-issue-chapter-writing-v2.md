## Description

### 📝 **Overview**

Transform Fictures from a complex chat/artifact/canvas system into a simplified chapter-focused writing platform. The current architecture is over-engineered for story writing and requires significant simplification to achieve optimal user experience.

### 🎯 **Goals**

- **Simplify UX**: Replace complex bimodal chat/canvas with simple dual-panel layout
- **Focus on Chapter Writing**: One chat per chapter instead of thread-based conversations
- **Remove Tool Complexity**: Eliminate function calls and AI tool orchestration
- **Direct Workflow**: Implement prompt → chapter content generation without artifacts
- **Improve Performance**: Reduce complexity and improve load times significantly

### 📋 **Research Documentation**

- **Research Report**: `/docs/chapter-writing-ux-transformation-research.md`
- **Technical Specifications**: Generated by plan-agent with detailed component interfaces
- **Implementation Timeline**: 5-phase approach over 5 weeks
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive mitigation strategies included

## 🏗️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- [ ] **Database Schema Updates**
  - [ ] Add `chatId` column to `Chapter` table

  - [ ] Add responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] **Chapter Chat Panel**
  - [ ] Build `ChapterChatPanel` component
  - [ ] Add prompt input with chapter context
  - [ ] Implement streaming response display
  - [ ] Add auto-save functionality
- [ ] **Chapter Viewer Panel**
  - [ ] Build `ChapterViewerPanel` component
  - [ ] Add markdown rendering with basic editing
  - [ ] Implement save/export functionality
  - [ ] Add word count and progress indicators

### **Phase 3: Legacy System Removal (Week 3)**
- [ ] **Remove Artifact System**
  - [ ] Archive `/components/artifact.tsx` and related files
  - [ ] Remove `/artifacts/` directory entirely
  - [ ] Clean up artifact-related imports and dependencies
- [ ] **Simplify Chat API**
  - [ ] Remove tool orchestration from `/app/api/chat/route.ts`
  - [ ] Remove tool definitions from `/lib/ai/tools/`
  - [ ] Simplify streaming logic for direct content generation
- [ ] **Database Cleanup**
  - [ ] Archive unused tables (`Document`, `Vote`, `Suggestion`)
  - [ ] Migrate relevant data to new chapter-focused structure
  - [ ] Update queries to use new relationships

### **Phase 4: Testing & Integration (Week 4)**
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - [ ] Unit tests for all new components
  - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] End-to-end tests for chapter writing workflow
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking (target: <1.5s load time)
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**
  - [ ] Beta testing with selected users
  - [ ] Usability testing sessions
  - [ ] Feedback collection and iteration
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Bundle size analysis and optimization
  - [ ] Database query optimization
  - [ ] Caching strategy implementation

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Rollout (Week 5)**
- [ ] **Feature Flag Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up feature flags for gradual rollout
  - [ ] Configure A/B testing infrastructure
  - [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] **Gradual Deployment**
  - [ ] 10% user rollout with monitoring
  - [ ] 50% rollout after validation

## 🔄 **Architecture Changes**

### **Before (Complex)**
```
/stories/create/[id] → Chat with artifacts/canvas
├── Bimodal interface with animations
├── Tool selection and function calls
├── Multiple document types and version control
└── Thread-based conversations
```

### **After (Simplified)**
```
/stories/[storyId]/chapters/[chapterNumber]/write
├── Dual panel: Chat input + Chapter viewer
├── Direct prompt → chapter generation
├── One chat per chapter (1:1 relationship)
└── Simple markdown editing with auto-save
```
