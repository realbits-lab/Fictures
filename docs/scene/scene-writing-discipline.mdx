# Scene Writing Discipline for AI Content Generation

## Core Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Readability
- **Primary Goal**: Create prose optimized for smartphone consumption
- **Target Reading Level**: 7th-9th grade (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Cognitive Load**: Minimize reader effort through clarity and simplicity

### 2. Momentum-Driven Narrative
- **Forward Movement**: Every element must drive the story forward
- **Zero Friction**: Remove any stylistic barriers to rapid consumption
- **Binge Optimization**: Design for continuous chapter-to-chapter reading

## Quantitative Parameters

### Sentence Structure
| Parameter | Target | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Words per Sentence | 15-20 words average | Vary between 8-30 for rhythm |
| Sentence Fragments | 5-10% of total | Use deliberately for emphasis |
| Active Voice | >90% | Passive only for specific effects |
| Vocabulary Level | 7th-9th grade | Common words, concrete nouns, strong verbs |

### Paragraph Structure
| Parameter | Target | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Sentences per Paragraph | 1-3 sentences | Single sentences for emphasis |
| Formatting | Block style | NO indentation, blank line between |
| White Space | Maximum | Short paragraphs create visual breathing room |

### Dialogue Parameters
| Parameter | Target | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Dialogue Ratio | 40-60% by word count | Balance with narration |
| Speaker Format | New speaker = New paragraph | Always maintain clarity |
| Action Tags | Every 2-3 dialogue lines | Ground characters in scene |
| Action Separation | Action on new line | NEVER combine dialogue + action in same line |

## Scene Type Protocols

### Action Scenes
```
PARAMETERS:
- Words per Sentence: 8-12 average
- Sentence Fragments: 15-20%
- Paragraph Length: 1-2 sentences max
- Focus: External action, sensory details
- Avoid: Internal monologue, complex emotions

EXAMPLE RHYTHM:
He dodged left.
The blade whistled past his ear. Close. Too close.
His fist connected with ribs—a wet crunch.
The enemy stumbled backward, gasping.
```

### Emotional/Introspective Scenes
```
PARAMETERS:
- Words per Sentence: 15-20 average
- Sentence Fragments: 2-5%
- Paragraph Length: 3-4 sentences
- Focus: Internal thoughts, memories, feelings
- Allow: Moderate sentence length for reflection

EXAMPLE RHYTHM:
The weight of the decision pressed down on her shoulders like a physical burden she couldn't shake. Every option led to pain—for her, for them, for everyone she'd sworn to protect. She closed her eyes and let herself remember the promise she'd made all those years ago.

Maybe promises were meant to be broken.
```

### Dialogue Scenes
```
PARAMETERS:
- Words per Sentence: 12-18 average
- Dialogue Lines: Short, punchy (5-15 words)
- Action Tags: Every 2-3 exchanges
- Focus: Character voice, conflict, information

EXAMPLE RHYTHM:
"You can't be serious."

Sarah crossed her arms.

"Dead serious."

Marcus didn't look up from the map.

"We leave at dawn."

"That's suicide."

"That's our only chance."

He finally met her gaze.

"Unless you have a better idea?"

She didn't.
```

## Content Generation Rules

### 1. Opening Hook Requirements
- **First Sentence**: Must create immediate engagement
- **First Paragraph**: Establish conflict, question, or tension
- **Avoid**: Info dumps, lengthy descriptions, slow builds

### 2. Scene Progression
- **Every 100 words**: Something must change (revelation, action, emotion)
- **Every paragraph**: Advance plot, character, or tension
- **Never**: Static description without narrative purpose

### 3. Ending Momentum
- **Final Paragraph**: Create forward pull to next scene
- **Options**: Unresolved question, new complication, emotional shift
- **Never**: Complete resolution without future hook

## Forbidden Practices

### NEVER Use:
1. **Paragraph indentation** - Breaks mobile formatting
2. **Walls of text** - Paragraphs over 4 sentences
3. **Complex vocabulary** - Words above 9th-grade level without purpose
4. **Passive voice chains** - Multiple passive constructions in sequence
5. **Pure description blocks** - Description without action/dialogue integration
6. **Slow starts** - Taking more than 50 words to establish conflict
7. **Complete resolution** - Ending without forward momentum

## Dynamic Style Modulation

### Pacing Through Prose
```
HIGH TENSION → Short sentences. Fragments. Active verbs.
MEDIUM TENSION → Balanced sentences, mixing lengths for rhythm.
LOW TENSION → Moderate sentences allowing for reflection and atmosphere.
```

### Emotional Intensity Mapping
```
CRISIS: 8-10 word sentences, heavy fragments
CONFLICT: 12-15 word sentences, occasional fragments
TENSION: 15-18 word sentences, standard structure
CALM: 15-20 word sentences, moderate complexity
```

## Implementation Checklist

### For Every Scene:
- [ ] Hook within first 30 words
- [ ] 40-60% dialogue ratio maintained
- [ ] No paragraph exceeds 3 sentences
- [ ] Active voice >90%
- [ ] Fragments used purposefully
- [ ] White space maximized
- [ ] Forward momentum sustained
- [ ] Ending creates pull to continue

### Quality Metrics:
- [ ] Readable on phone screen without scrolling per paragraph
- [ ] No cognitive friction points
- [ ] Clear speaker attribution in dialogue
- [ ] Action beats ground the scene
- [ ] Vocabulary accessible to target audience
- [ ] Rhythm varies with content

## AI System Prompt Template

```
Generate a [SCENE TYPE] scene following these parameters:

STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Average 15-20 words per sentence
- Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph
- Block paragraph format (no indents)
- 40-60% dialogue by word count
- Active voice >90%

STYLE MODULATION:
[IF action]: Reduce to 8-12 WPS, increase fragments to 15%
[IF emotional]: Maintain 15-20 WPS, allow 3-4 sentence paragraphs
[IF dialogue]: Maintain speaker clarity, add action tags every 2-3 lines on separate lines

PACING:
- Hook in first 30 words
- Change/revelation every 100 words
- End with forward momentum

VOCABULARY:
- Target 7th-9th grade reading level
- Concrete nouns and strong verbs
- Avoid abstract concepts and complex descriptions

FORMAT:
- New speaker = new paragraph
- Single blank line between paragraphs
- Sentence fragments for emphasis only
```

## Examples of Effective Scene Openings

### Action Hook:
```
The knife missed his throat by inches.

Marcus rolled left, glass crunching under his shoulder. The second strike wouldn't miss.
```

### Mystery Hook:
```
Three people knew the truth about that night.

Two were dead.

Sarah stared at the photograph and wondered how long she had left.
```

### Emotional Hook:
```
The letter had six words.

"I know what you did. -A"

Emma's hands wouldn't stop shaking.
```

## Final Notes

This discipline prioritizes **reader retention** over literary elegance. Every stylistic choice serves the singular goal of creating an addictive, frictionless reading experience optimized for serial consumption on mobile devices. The prose is not "dumbed down" but rather **precision-engineered** for its specific medium and audience.

When implementing these guidelines, remember: The story is the signal, the prose is merely the carrier wave. Optimize for maximum signal clarity and minimum transmission loss.
