# Scene Specification (Level 4: Story Units)

## Definition and Purpose

**Scenes** are the fundamental building blocks of web serial chapters, where story events unfold in real-time for readers. In serial fiction, scenes must create immediate engagement while building toward chapter-level hooks and cliffhangers. Each scene contributes to the episodic satisfaction that keeps readers returning for new installments.

## Key Functions in Planning

- **Engagement Optimization**: Design each scene to create immediate reader investment and emotional connection
- **Tension Building**: Develop conflicts that contribute to chapter-level cliffhangers and reader anticipation
- **Character Moment Creation**: Plan scenes that give readers memorable character interactions worth discussing
- **Information Strategy**: Control revelation pacing to maintain mystery and generate reader speculation
- **Emotional Beat Planning**: Structure scenes to create the emotional highs and lows that drive serial engagement
- **Community Hook Integration**: Include details and moments designed to generate reader comments and theories
- **Serial Momentum**: Ensure each scene builds toward the chapter's hook while providing immediate satisfaction
- **Reader Experience Focus**: Match scene pacing and content to the serial reading experience and publication rhythm

## YAML Data Structure for Scene Planning

```yaml
scenes:
  - order: 1
    title: "Normal Morning"

    # Pre-Scene Planning Framework
    pre_scene_planning:
      - "The scene occurs outside Elena's apartment building on a quiet residential street during Sunday morning at 10 AM, with Maya Chen as POV character while Elena is absent but present through environmental traces."
      - "The scene begins with casual, routine expectations but gradually builds to worried concern as Maya's peace of mind and family connection become threatened by the mystery of Elena's safety."

    # Scene Execution Framework
    scene_execution:
      - "The scene begins with Maya arriving at Elena's building and checking her phone, grounded by sensory details like Elena's parked car, echoing knocks, and the weight of the spare key."
      - "The scene uses minimal external dialogue, focusing on Maya's internal voice and one-sided conversation, while maintaining a deliberate build from routine normalcy to growing concern."

    # Post-Scene Evaluation Framework
    post_scene_evaluation:
      - "Maya fails to achieve her goal of a normal visit with Elena, but this failure becomes the story's inciting incident while revealing her protective and persistent nature."
      - "The mystery is established and Maya's investigation is launched, moving from normal world into supernatural territory while creating a compelling hook through Maya's growing unease."
