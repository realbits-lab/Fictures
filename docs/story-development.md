## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Story Foundation

Converting user input into structured story concepts that will drive the development process.

**1.1 Story Concept Development**

```yaml
story_concept_development:
  input:
    user_prompt: "I want to write an urban fantasy story about two sisters in San Francisco. Maya is a photographer who discovers she has shadow magic when her younger sister Elena disappears into a parallel realm. Maya must learn to control her dangerous powers to save Elena before she's lost forever."

  process:
    - analyze_user_prompt: "Extract core elements from raw text"
    - identify_genre_elements: "Determine genre conventions and tropes"
    - extract_characters: "Identify main and supporting characters"
    - define_central_conflict: "Establish primary dramatic question"
    - determine_setting: "Extract world and location details"
    - establish_themes: "Identify underlying messages and meanings"

  output:
    story_concept:
      title: "The Shadow Keeper"
      genre: "urban fantasy"
      character_hierarchy:
        protagonist:
          character_name: "Maya Chen"
          narrative_function: "hero"
          character_archetype: "reluctant_hero"
          story_role: "primary_viewpoint"
        deuteragonist:
          character_name: "Elena Chen"
          narrative_function: "catalyst"
          character_archetype: "missing_person"
          story_role: "motivation_source"
        tritagonist:

          narrative_function: "opposition"
          character_archetype: "supernatural_threat"
          story_role: "primary_obstacle"
      primary_setting: ["San Francisco", "Maya's studio"]
      secondary_settings: ["Shadow Realm", "Chinatown passages"]
      main_plot_elements:
        [
          "Elena's disappearance",
          "Maya's magical discovery",
          "Void Collector threat",
        ]
      core_themes:
        ["responsibility for power", "love and control", "internal battles"]
      central_question: "Can Maya master dangerous shadow magic to save Elena before power corrupts her?"
      target_word_count: 80000
      story_structure:
        type: "3-part"
        parts: ["Setup", "Confrontation", "Resolution"]

## Development Tools and Resources

### Character Architecture Framework

**Character Role Classification**

- **Primary Tier**: Protagonist (hero/heroine), Deuteragonist (secondary lead), Tritagonist (tertiary lead)
- **Opposition Tier**: Antagonist (primary opposition), Foil (contrasting character)
- **Support Tier**: Mentor (wisdom giver), Ally (companion), Threshold Guardian (challenger)
- **Function Tier**: Catalyst (change agent), Herald (messenger), Trickster (wildcard)

**Character Arc Types**

- **Positive Change Arc**: Character overcomes flaws and grows (most protagonists)
- **Negative Change Arc**: Character succumbs to flaws and declines (tragic heroes, corruption)
- **Flat/Static Arc**: Character remains consistent, influences others (mentors, catalysts)

**Ensemble Cast Structure**

- **Plotline Distribution**: Each major character drives different plot types (external, internal, relationship)
- **Connection Requirements**: All characters must influence or be influenced by dominating plotline
- **Character Interconnection**: Relationship dynamics evolve temporally throughout narrative

### AI Integration Functions

**Context Building**

- `buildHierarchyContext(partId)`: Assembles complete story context for AI generation
- `getCharacterStates(partId)`: Retrieves current character emotional and plot states
- `getActivePlotThreads(partId)`: Identifies ongoing narrative elements
- `analyzeCharacterRelationships(partId)`: Maps relationship dynamics and temporal evolution

**Content Generation**

- `enhanceDialogue(characters, context)`: Improves character voice authenticity
- `developCharacterArc(character, storyPosition)`: Advances character development
- `balanceEnsembleCast(characters)`: Ensures proper character role distribution

**Quality Assurance**

- `validateConsistency(hierarchy)`: Checks story coherence across all levels
- `verifyCharacterFunctions(roles)`: Confirms narrative functions are fulfilled

### Development Workflows

**Iterative Development Cycle**

1. **Plan**: Define objectives for current development session
2. **Create**: Generate content using AI tools and hierarchical context
3. **Review**: Validate consistency and quality across hierarchy levels
4. **Refine**: Optimize content based on quality review

**Quality Gates**

- Character voice consistency verification
- Plot thread progression validation
- World-building coherence checking

## Best Practices

### Story Development

1. **Maintain Hierarchy Awareness**: Always consider how current work fits within the complete story structure
2. **Character-Driven Development**: Ensure character agency drives plot progression at all levels
3. **Flexible Planning**: Balance detailed planning with adaptability based on story needs

### AI Collaboration

1. **Context-Rich Prompting**: Provide comprehensive story context for AI generation
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Use AI as a collaborative partner, not a replacement for creative judgment
3. **Consistency Validation**: Regularly check AI-generated content against established story elements
