## Rationale

### Why 30 Minutes?

**Typical Reading Session Analysis:**

```
Average reader speed: 200-250 words/minute
Average chapter: 2000-4000 words
Time per chapter: 8-20 minutes

Typical session:
- Browse story list: 2-5 minutes
- Read chapter 1: 10-15 minutes
- Read chapter 2: 10-15 minutes
- Switch to another story: 3-5 minutes
─────────────────────────────────────
Total: 25-40 minutes
```

**30 minutes covers:**
- ✅ Reading 2-3 chapters
- ✅ Browsing and comparing stories
- ✅ Switching between multiple stories
- ✅ Taking short breaks
- ✅ Coming back after interruption

### Memory Impact

**Memory Usage Per Cache:**
```
Story list:      148 KB
Story structure:  32 KB
Scene content:     9 KB × 3 chapters = 27 KB
─────────────────────────────────────
Total:           207 KB (~0.2 MB)
```

**Comparison:**
- Single high-res image: 500 KB - 2 MB
- Single YouTube video frame: 1-5 MB
- Chrome tab baseline: 50-100 MB
- **Our 30min cache: 0.2 MB** ← Negligible!

**Conclusion:** 30 minutes of cache retention uses trivial memory compared to normal web browsing.

## Performance Impact

### Load Times

**Story List:**
```
Before: 5min cache
- Within 5min: ~0ms (instant)
- After 5min:  ~5ms (localStorage)

After: 30min cache
- Within 30min: ~0ms (instant) ← 6x longer instant loads!
- After 30min:  ~5ms (localStorage)
```

**Story Structure:**
```
Before: 10min cache
- Within 10min: ~0ms (instant)
- After 10min:  ~5ms (localStorage)

After: 30min cache
- Within 30min: ~0ms (instant) ← 3x longer instant loads!
- After 30min:  ~5ms (localStorage)
```

**Scene Content:**
```
Before: 10sec cache
- Within 10sec: ~0ms (instant)
- After 10sec:  ~8ms (localStorage)

After: 30min cache
- Within 30min: ~0ms (instant) ← 180x longer instant loads!
- After 30min:  ~8ms (localStorage)
```

### User Experience

**Typical Reading Flow (30min session):**

```
User opens story list
  ↓
Loads instantly (from SWR memory) ⚡
  ↓
Clicks on "Jupiter's Maw"
  ↓
Story structure loads instantly ⚡
  ↓
Reads Chapter 1 (15 minutes)
  ↓
Scene content loads instantly ⚡
  ↓
Navigates back to story list
  ↓
Still in memory - instant! ⚡
  ↓
Starts reading different story
  ↓
Story structure loads instantly ⚡
  ↓
Finishes reading
  ↓
Total session: 28 minutes
ALL data still in memory - everything instant! ⚡⚡⚡
```

**Before (5-10min cache):**
- User would hit localStorage reload 2-3 times
- Noticeable 5-10ms delays
- Feels slower after 10 minutes

**After (30min cache):**
- Zero localStorage reloads in typical session
- Everything feels instant
- Professional native app experience

## Cache Eviction Strategy

### Automatic Cleanup

**SWR handles memory management automatically:**
1. After 30 minutes of inactivity, data MAY be evicted
2. When component unmounts, data is kept for `dedupingInterval`
3. If memory pressure increases, browser may garbage collect
4. When user closes tab, all memory cache is cleared

### Manual Cleanup

Users can manually clear cache if needed:

**Via Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Clear specific cache
cacheManager.clearCachedData('/reading/api/published');

// Clear all localStorage cache
cacheManager.clearAllCache();

// Refresh browser to clear SWR memory cache
location.reload();
```

**Via UI (if implemented):**
- Settings → Cache Management → Clear Cache
- Automatic cleanup on user logout

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Page Reload
- **SWR memory:** Cleared (by design)
- **localStorage:** Persists
- **Result:** First load after reload uses localStorage (~5ms)
- **Subsequent loads:** From SWR memory (~0ms)

### 2. Tab Close/Reopen
- **SWR memory:** Cleared
- **localStorage:** Persists
- **Result:** Same as page reload

### 3. Long Reading Session (> 30min)
- **After 30 min:** Data may be evicted from memory
- **Fallback:** Load from localStorage (~5ms)
- **Still fast:** Better than API fetch (~1500ms)

### 4. Multiple Tabs
- **Each tab:** Has own SWR memory cache
- **Shared:** localStorage cache across tabs
- **Result:** Each tab instant within its 30min window

### 5. Memory Pressure
- **Browser:** May garbage collect unused data
- **Graceful degradation:** Falls back to localStorage
- **No errors:** SWR handles this automatically

## Testing

### Manual Test - Extended Session

```bash
# Test scenario: 30-minute reading session
1. Visit /reading (story list)
   → Should load instantly from memory

2. Open a story
   → Should load instantly from memory

3. Read for 15 minutes
   → All scenes load instantly from memory

4. Navigate back to story list
   → Should load instantly from memory (still within 30min)

5. Open different story
   → Should load instantly from memory (still within 30min)

6. Read for another 10 minutes
   → All data still instant (25min total)

7. Take 5-minute break
   → Return and navigate
   → Everything still instant (30min total)

8. Wait 31 minutes
   → Next navigation uses localStorage (~5ms)
   → Still fast, just not instant
```

### Performance Verification

**Check SWR memory cache hit rate:**
```javascript
// In browser console
performance.mark('navigation-start');
// Navigate to cached page
performance.mark('navigation-end');
performance.measure('navigation', 'navigation-start', 'navigation-end');
console.log(performance.getEntriesByName('navigation'));
// Expect: < 1ms if from SWR memory
// Expect: 5-10ms if from localStorage
```

## Configuration Summary

### Final Cache Retention Settings

```typescript
// Story List
usePublishedStories: {
  dedupingInterval: 30 * 60 * 1000,  // 30 minutes
  keepPreviousData: true
}

// Story Structure
useStoryReader: {
  dedupingInterval: 30 * 60 * 1000,  // 30 minutes
  keepPreviousData: true
}

// Scene Content
useChapterScenes: {
  dedupingInterval: 30 * 60 * 1000,  // 30 minutes
  keepPreviousData: true
}
```

### localStorage TTL (Unchanged)

```typescript
// localStorage remains the same
CACHE_CONFIGS.reading: {
  ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 1 hour
  version: '1.1.0',
  compress: true
}
```

**Why different?**
- SWR memory: 30 min (optimize for active session)
- localStorage: 1 hour (persist for later return)

## Rollout

### Deployment
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - Client-side only changes
- ✅ **No migration needed** - Backward compatible
- ✅ **Immediate effect** - Takes effect on next page load
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - Graceful degradation

### Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
```javascript
// Cache hit rate
cacheHits / (cacheHits + cacheMisses)
Target: > 90% for 30min sessions

// Average load time
sum(loadTimes) / count(loads)
Target: < 2ms average

// Memory usage
process.memoryUsage().heapUsed
Target: < 100MB per tab
```
