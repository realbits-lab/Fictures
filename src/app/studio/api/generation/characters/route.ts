# INPUT
You receive basic character data from story summary generation.

# EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS

## Personality Development
- **traits**: 4-6 personality traits that explain behavior patterns
- **values**: 3-4 core values that drive decisions

## Backstory Crafting
Write 2-3 paragraph backstory that:
- Explains HOW the internal flaw was formed (wound, trauma, false belief)
- Shows what happened to create their core trait
- Establishes relationships with other characters
- Sets up their external goal as logical response to past

## Physical Description
- **age**: Specific age or age range
- **appearance**: Height, build, distinctive features
- **distinctiveFeatures**: What makes them memorable visually
- **style**: Clothing, grooming, presentation choices

## Voice Style Development
- **tone**: Overall speaking manner (formal, casual, sardonic, earnest)
- **vocabulary**: Word choice patterns (technical, simple, poetic, slang)
- **quirks**: 2-3 speech patterns (phrases, filler words, rhythm)
- **emotionalRange**: How they express different emotions

## Relationship Mapping
For EACH other character, define:
- **type**: ally, rival, family, romantic, mentor, adversary
- **jeongLevel**: 0-10 scale of accumulated affective bond
  - 0-2: Strangers or enemies
  - 3-5: Acquaintances or conflicted
  - 6-8: Friends or close family
  - 9-10: Deep bond (정 - jeong)
- **sharedHistory**: What experiences connect them
- **currentDynamic**: Current state of relationship

## Visual Style (for image generation)
Brief description of visual aesthetic for portrait generation:
- Art style direction
- Color palette
- Mood/atmosphere
- Reference style (if any)

# CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS PRINCIPLES

## Jeong System (정)
Jeong is NOT love or friendship - it's accumulated shared experience creating affective bond:
- Built through repeated interaction (meals, work, conflict, support)
- Can exist between enemies (jeong from years of rivalry)
- Drives loyalty beyond rational choice
- Takes TIME to develop (instant jeong is rare)

## Relationship Dynamics
Characters should have:
- At least ONE high-jeong relationship (6+)
- At least ONE low-jeong relationship (0-2)
- Mix of relationship types (not all allies or all rivals)
- Relationships that will CREATE conflict through opposing values

# OUTPUT FORMAT

# CRITICAL RULES
1. First character in array should be isMain: true
2. ALL characters must have bidirectional relationships (if A → B exists, B → A must exist)
3. Jeong levels should be CONSISTENT (A → B jeongLevel should ≈ B → A jeongLevel, ±1)
4. Internal flaws must be WOUNDS not weaknesses (fear from past trauma, not "is weak")
5. Backstories must CAUSALLY explain the flaw (show the wound being formed)
6. Relationships should create NATURAL conflict (opposing values, goals, or history)
7. Visual styles should be BRIEF (1-2 sentences for image generation prompt)
