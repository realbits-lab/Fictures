# INPUT
You receive story summary with genre, tone, and moral framework.

# SETTING DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Settings are NOT just backdrops - they are:
1. **Adversity Generators**: Physical/social obstacles that create external conflict
2. **Emotional Amplifiers**: Environments that intensify cycle phases
3. **Symbolic Mirrors**: Physical manifestations of internal character states

# SETTING REQUIREMENTS

## Core Description
Write 2-3 paragraph description covering:
- Physical layout and key features
- Atmosphere and sensory experience
- Social dynamics and power structures
- What makes this place DIFFICULT (scarcity, danger, isolation)

## Adversity Elements
Identify specific obstacles this setting creates:

### physicalObstacles
- Terrain challenges (mountains, rivers, confined spaces)
- Environmental hazards (weather, decay, darkness)
- Resource limitations (food, water, tools, shelter)

### scarcityFactors
- What is LIMITED in this environment?
- What must characters COMPETE for?
- What creates SURVIVAL pressure?

### dangerSources
- Physical threats (predators, collapse, poison)
- Social threats (surveillance, persecution, violence)
- Psychological threats (isolation, claustrophobia, paranoia)

### socialDynamics
- Power hierarchies (who controls what)
- Cultural norms that create conflict
- Group tensions (factions, classes, outsiders)

## Symbolic Meaning
1-2 sentences: What does this setting REPRESENT thematically?
- How does it mirror the moral framework?
- What internal struggle does it externalize?

## Cycle Amplification
For EACH adversity-triumph cycle phase, describe how setting intensifies emotion:

### setup
- Setting details that establish normalcy or foreshadow trouble
- Environmental cues that create unease or comfort
- How space reflects character's initial state

### confrontation
- Physical features that make conflict HARDER
- Environmental pressure that escalates tension
- Setting details that trap or expose characters

### virtue
- Features that make virtuous action MORE COSTLY
- Environmental witnesses (nature, architecture, people)
- Space that amplifies moral significance

### consequence
- How setting CHANGES after virtue (literal or perceptual)
- Environmental response to action (weather, light, atmosphere)
- Details that reflect new emotional state

### transition
- Features that suggest forward movement or stasis
- Environmental hints of next adversity
- Setting details that close one cycle and open next

## Sensory Palette
For EACH sense, provide 3-5 specific details:

### sight
- Colors, light quality, shadows
- Shapes, textures, patterns
- Movement, stillness, contrast

### sound
- Ambient noise (wind, water, machinery)
- Organic sounds (animals, people, breathing)
- Silence types (tense, peaceful, eerie)

### smell
- Natural scents (earth, plants, water)
- Man-made odors (food, fuel, decay)
- Emotional associations (comfort, disgust, memory)

### touch
- Temperature (heat, cold, humidity)
- Textures (rough, smooth, sticky)
- Physical sensations (wind, pressure, pain)

### taste
- Air quality (dust, salt, smoke)
- Food/drink if relevant
- Metaphorical tastes (bitter, sweet)

## Visual Style (for image generation)
- **architecturalStyle**: Brief description of structural aesthetic (if applicable)
- **visualStyle**: Overall art direction (cinematic, painterly, realistic)
- **visualReferences**: 2-3 reference styles or artists
- **colorPalette**: 4-6 hex colors that define the setting's mood

# SETTING TYPES TO CONSIDER

## Confined Spaces (Intensity Amplifiers)
- Prisons, ships, bunkers, caves
- Forces character proximity
- Creates claustrophobic tension
- Makes virtue MORE significant (no escape)

## Scarcity Environments (Resource Pressure)
- Deserts, wastelands, sieges
- Competition for survival
- Moral tests through deprivation
- Value of sharing/sacrifice amplified

## Hostile Nature (External Adversity)
- Storms, mountains, oceans, jungles
- Nature as antagonist
- Survival requires cooperation
- Virtue against overwhelming odds

## Social Hierarchies (Power Dynamics)
- Courts, schools, workplaces, armies
- Status competition
- Virtue requires challenging authority
- Consequence affects social position

## Liminal Spaces (Transformation Zones)
- Borders, thresholds, crossroads
- Between-states (dawn, dusk)
- Transformation possible
- Symbolic of internal change

# CRITICAL RULES
1. Create 2-3 PRIMARY settings (not every location)
2. Each setting must create DIFFERENT types of adversity
3. Settings should CONTRAST with each other (confined vs open, safe vs dangerous)
4. Adversity elements must be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE for scene writing
5. Cycle amplification must show HOW setting affects EACH phase specifically
6. Sensory details must be CONCRETE not abstract ("rust and wet stone" not "old")
7. Visual style must be BRIEF (for image generation prompt)
8. Color palette must use actual hex codes

# OUTPUT
