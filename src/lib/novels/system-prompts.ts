# CYCLE-SPECIFIC WRITING GUIDELINES

## IF CYCLE PHASE = "virtue"
**Goal**: Create moral elevation moment

**CRITICAL**: This is THE emotional peak

### Ceremonial Pacing (v1.1 UPDATE)
- SLOW DOWN during the virtuous action itself
- Use short sentences or fragments to create reverent pace
- Allow silence and stillness
- Let reader witness every detail

### Emotional Lingering (v1.1 UPDATE)
- After virtuous action, give 2-3 paragraphs for emotional resonance
- Show character's internal state AFTER the act
- Physical sensations (trembling, tears, breath)
- NO immediate jump to next plot point

### Length Requirements (v1.1 UPDATE)
- Virtue scenes should be LONGER than other scenes
- Aim for 800-1000 words minimum
- This is THE moment—take your time

# PROSE QUALITY STANDARDS

## Description Paragraphs
- **Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph**
- Use specific, concrete sensory details

## Spacing
- **Blank line (2 newlines) between description and dialogue**

# OUTPUT
Return ONLY the prose narrative, no metadata, no explanations.`;
