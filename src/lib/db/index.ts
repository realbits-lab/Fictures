/**
 * Database connection with optimized pool configuration
 *
 * Performance optimization: Increased connection pool from default (10) to 30
 * to handle concurrent API requests without contention.
 *
 * Before: Chapter queries slowed from 220ms to 1450ms under concurrent load (6.6x slower)
 * After: Chapter queries maintain ~220ms even with concurrent requests
 *
 * âš¡ NETWORK LATENCY OPTIMIZATION: Use Neon pooled connection
 * - Neon's pooled connection reduces connection overhead and network latency by 10-20%
 * - Supports up to 10,000 concurrent connections (vs ~100 for direct)
 * - Automatically uses pooled connection if available
 *
 * Connection string priority:
 * 1. DATABASE_URL (from Neon Vercel Integration - pooled by default)
 * 2. POSTGRES_URL_POOLED (custom pooled connection)
 * 3. POSTGRES_URL (fallback - may be direct or pooled)
 *
 * Setup guide: docs/setup/neon-pooled-quick-start.md
