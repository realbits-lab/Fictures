## Scene Content to Evaluate

${sceneContent}

## Evaluation Framework

Evaluate this scene across five core dimensions, grounding your analysis in the principles of serialized fiction:

### 1. Plot & Progression (Chapter-Level Focus)

Assess the scene's contribution to narrative momentum:

- **Hook Effectiveness**: Does the scene open with something engaging? Is there an immediate reason for the reader to continue?
- **Goal Clarity**: Is there a clear scene-level objective? What does the protagonist/POV character want in this specific moment?
- **Conflict & Stakes**: Are there meaningful obstacles and consequences? Is the conflict compelling and relevant?
- **Cliffhanger/Transition**: Does it end with momentum? Does it create a desire to read the next scene?

### 2. Character & Connection

Evaluate how well the scene develops and portrays characters:

- **Agency**: Do characters make active choices that drive the scene forward, or are they passive?
- **Voice Distinction**: Do characters sound unique? Can you distinguish different characters by dialogue alone?
- **Emotional Depth**: Are emotions shown through action, body language, and subtext rather than told?
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Do character interactions reveal personality, conflict, and relationships?

### 3. Pacing & Momentum

Analyze the scene's rhythm and forward movement:

- **Micro-Pacing**: Does each beat move the scene forward? Is there unnecessary filler?
- **Tension Management**: Is tension built and released effectively? Does the scene have a clear emotional arc?
- **Scene Economy**: Is every line purposeful? Does each paragraph contribute to goal, character, or atmosphere?

### 4. Prose & Voice

Evaluate the technical quality and style of the writing:

- **Clarity**: Is the writing clear and engaging? Can the reader easily visualize what's happening?
- **Show Don't Tell**: Are emotions and actions demonstrated through specific details rather than abstract statements?
- **Voice Consistency**: Is the narrative voice maintained throughout? Does the tone match the genre and scene purpose?
- **Technical Quality**: Grammar, syntax, word choice—are there distracting errors or awkward phrasing?

### 5. World-Building Integration

Assess how setting and world details are woven into the scene:

- **Natural Integration**: Are world details woven into action and dialogue, or delivered through exposition dumps?
- **Consistency**: Do details align with the established world and genre conventions?
- **Mystery Generation**: Does the scene create intrigue about the world without over-explaining?

## Output Requirements

For each dimension, provide:

1. **Score (1-4)**:
   - 1 = Nascent: Significant issues that undermine the scene
   - 2 = Developing: Some effectiveness but notable weaknesses
   - 3 = Effective: Solid execution that achieves its purpose
   - 4 = Exemplary: Masterful execution that elevates the story

2. **Performance Level**: Nascent, Developing, Effective, or Exemplary

3. **One Key Strength**: Explain what works well, citing specific text evidence
   - Format: { "point": "What works", "evidence": "Quoted or referenced text" }

4. **One Key Improvement**: Explain what could be better, citing specific text evidence
   - Format: { "point": "What needs work", "evidence": "Quoted or referenced text" }

## Actionable Feedback (Diagnose & Suggest Model)

Provide 2-3 pieces of actionable feedback following this structure:

1. **Diagnosis**: Clearly state the root cause of a narrative issue
   - Example: "The protagonist's motivation feels inconsistent because their actions are driven by plot necessity rather than established personality."

2. **Suggestion**: Propose a specific writing technique or exercise to address the issue
   - Frame as a tool for improvement, not a prescription
   - Example: "Before revising this scene, write a short paragraph from the protagonist's point of view answering: 'What am I most afraid of losing right now?' Use that fear to guide their decisions."

3. **Priority**: Classify as high, medium, or low priority
