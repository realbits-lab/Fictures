## Blockers & Issues

### Critical Dependencies

1. **Database Migrations:** Must be applied in correct order
2. **Tiptap Installation:** Required for rich text editor
3. **Recharts Installation:** Required for analytics charts
4. **Vercel Blob Setup:** Required for image uploads

### Known Risks

1. **Migration Conflicts:** Multiple specs update same tables
2. **Mock Data Removal:** Must ensure real data is working first
3. **Testing Auth:** Need valid session for E2E tests

- API Routes: 8 new route files
- Components: 4 new React components
- Integration: 1 file modified (ChapterReaderClient.tsx)
- Scripts: 5 helper scripts for database operations

**Time Spent:** ~2 hours
**Estimated Completion:** 25% of total project
